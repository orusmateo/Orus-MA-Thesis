\section{Application of Sarajlić et al. configurations to three-dimensional graphlets}
As part of my style guide for Query Isomorphs analysis, I propose that the Sarajlić et al. graphlet configurations \citep[p. 3]{sarajlic_graphlet-based_2016} can be used for graph input and graph analysis.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/5.6.png}
    \caption[Example Query Isomorph in two dimensions and three dimensions assembled from directed graphlets]{\textbf{Example Query Isomorph in two dimensions and three dimensions assembled from directed graphlets.} \\
(a) From Sarajlić et al. 2016’s point b, “Illustration of how directed graphlets assemble together to form complex networks”, from “Figure 1. Illustration of directed graphlets” \citep[p. 3]{sarajlic_graphlet-based_2016}. In keeping with Sarajlić et al., the whole network can be created by adding graphlets G4, G1, and G3, meaning that in the process, a new graphlet, G2, was created. The colours red, green, blue, and black are sourced from \citep[p. 3]{sarajlic_graphlet-based_2016}. (b) Spatial arrangement adds the semantic affordance of verticality to communicate hierarchy of the blue node. Red nodes are querying for nodes in both higher and lateral hierarchies. (c) Other arrangements can easily facilitate different relationships in the Query Isomorph. (b) and (c) The colours red, green, and blue are sourced from \citep[p. 3]{sarajlic_graphlet-based_2016} here also, but white is used instead of black for contrast. Black nodes in this example are all placed in a lateral level of hierarchy. In a functional Query Isomorph platform, nodes could also be placed higher or lower than each other. Furthermore, the angles and directions of these graphlets are presented for simplicity of the variety they can have but do not represent the diversity of angles and forms that graphlets can be configured in as Query Isomorphs.

    \caption[Horn of Futures]{\textbf{Horn of Futures.} This figure depicts the 2D dimensional reduction of the bottom view of a modified 3D Cone of Plausibility \citetext{\citealp[p. 73]{bezold_overview_1993}; \citealp[p. 14]{taylor_creating_1990}}. This Cone Semantic Form is curved into a spiral similar to \autoref{fig:18} “Diagram of a design process with iterations” \citetext{\citealp[p. 343]{sevaldson_designing_2022}; \citealp{sevaldson_designing_2022-1}}. The 3D version of this form twists like a ram’s horn, and this thesis involves the study of the horn torus, hence the name \textit{Horn of Futures}. To represent Possible futures, the widest spiralling area is represented with a black colour, Plausible futures in dark grey, Probable futures in light grey, and Preferable futures is shown as a beige deviation from the Probable futures. The middle of the Preferable futures range is labelled with a green through-line, and the middle of the light grey Probable range is labelled with a red through-line.}
