By fine-tuning on denoising tasks, we developed RFdiffusion All-Atom (RFdiffusionAA), which builds protein structures around small molecules. Starting from random distributions of amino acid residues surrounding target small molecules, we designed and experimentally validated, through crystallography and binding measurements, proteins that bind the cardiac disease therapeutic digoxigenin, the enzymatic cofactor heme, and the light-harvesting molecule bilin.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

To determine how information is represented in this area, we measured spatial modulation of neural activity in layers of medial entorhinal cortex projecting to the hippocampus. Close to the postrhinal-entorhinal border, entorhinal neurons had stable and discrete multipeaked place fields, predicting the rat's location as accurately as place cells in the hippocampus. Precise positional modulation was not observed more ventromedially in the entorhinal cortex or upstream in the postrhinal cortex, suggesting that sensory input is transformed into durable allocentric spatial representations internally in the dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex.},

To determine how information about location, direction, and distance is integrated in the grid-cell network, we recorded from each principal cell layer of MEC in rats that explored two-dimensional environments. Whereas layer II was predominated by grid cells, grid cells colocalized with head-direction cells and conjunctive grid × head-direction cells in the deeper layers. All cell types were modulated by running speed. The conjunction of positional, directional, and translational information in a single MEC cell type may enable grid coordinates to be updated during self-motion–based navigation.},

Other nerve cells were activated at other places. He proposed that these “place cells” build up an inner map of the environment. Place cells are located in a part of the brain called the hippocampus.  May-Britt och Edvard I. Moser discovered in 2005 that other nerve cells in a nearby part of the brain, the entorhinal cortex, were activated when the rat passed certain locations. Together, these locations formed a hexagonal grid, each “grid cell” reacting in a unique spatial pattern. Collectively, these grid cells form a coordinate system that allows for spatial navigation. Grid cells, together with other cells in the entorhinal cortex that recognize the direction of the head of the animal and the border of the room, form networks with the place cells in the hippocampus. This circuitry constitutes a comprehensive positioning system, an inner GPS, in the brain. The positioning system in the human brain appears to have similar components as those of the rat brain. llustration and layout: Mattias Karlén},

abstract = {Purpose - The World-Wide Web (W-3) initiative is a practical project designed to bring a global information universe into existence using    available technology. This paper seeks to describe the aims, data model, and protocols needed to implement the \&quot;web\&quot; and to compare them with various contemporary systems. Design/methodology/approach - Since Vannevar Bush's article, men have dreamed of extending their intellect by making their collective knowledge available to each individual by using machines. Computers provide us two practical techniques for human-knowledge interface. One is hypertext, in which links between pieces of text (or other media)    mimic human association of ideas. The other is text retrieval, which    allows associations to be deduced from the content of text. The W-3 ideal world allows both operations and provides access from any browsing platform. Findings - Various server gateways to other information systems have been produced, and the total amount of information available on the web is becoming very significant, especially since it includes all anonymous FTP archives, WAIS servers, and Gopher servers as well as specific W-3 servers. Originality/value - The paper notices that a W-3 server could provide the functions of each of these servers, and so it looks forward to a single protocol that can be used by the whole community.},

  abstract = {The current trajectory of artificial intelligence development suffers from fundamental epistemological shortcomings, resulting in the systematic operationalization of bias against non-white, non-male, and non-Western peoples. We argue that these failings are, in part, the result of certain Western rationalist epistemologies that exclude many ways of knowing about the world, and therefore they cannot provide a sufficient foundation on which to adequately, robustly, and humanely conceptualize intelligence. We present a new research agenda, Abundant Intelligences, an Indigenous-led, Indigenous-majority international, interdisciplinary research program that imagines anew how to conceptualize and design artificial intelligence (AI) based on Indigenous knowledge (IK) systems. Abundant Intelligences draws on the rich plurality of Indigenous knowledge systems, bringing together diverse sets of thought, culture, and protocol together. We show IK systems provide one way to rebuild AI’s epistemological foundations and transform these tools’ current role in reinforcing colonial practices of exclusion, extraction, manipulation, and eradication into engines of abundance that enable us to care better for ourselves, our communities, and our world. Our proposition is to fully engage with AI to explore how different conceptions of intelligence could be embodied in these technologies. In this paper, we present the tenets of the research program in detail, account for our methodological approach, describe the impact and limitations, and conclude on a discussion of the implications of the program.},

  abstract = {Isi-pîkiskwêwin-Ayapihkêsîsak (Speaking the Language of Spiders) This project is an Internet World Wide Web site that consists of an interactive screenplay and multi-media storyboard. The underlying thematic context of the screenplay is based on an examination of the differences in world view and the construction of reality that occur between cultures structured by First Nations languages and those constructed by English language. It involves the use of poetic, fragmentary, highly visual and intuitive modes of expression that bring into play the ways in which First Nations historic cultural paradigms, and ancestral and animistic spiritual forces operate in a very real manner in contemporary First Nations culture. This work concentrates on the experiences of people who have been consigned to the fringes of urban streetlife and their sources of joy, grief and intense humanity. It is a recognition that they are being rendered more and more invisible, yet are being further institutionally objectified in the increasingly neoconservative climate of contemporary Canadian culture. This project is not intended to add to sociological theories about these issues. Its process of creation has been a difficult and often intensely personal examination that owes a great deal to memory, dreams, stories, songs, family and community. It avoids conventional morality and social analysis in favour of creatively honouring those who have achieved the miracle of survival in the face of inhuman odds, and those who have not. For many of the artists it has also involved negotiating the risky and sometimes dangerous balance between loss and hope. The screenplay and storyboard are produced entirely on the World Wide Web in order to construct networks of relationships between the elements at each stage of development as a primary part of the work. The current stage of development of Isi-pîkiskwêwin-Ayapihkêsîsak has been constructed through the collaborative influence and creative participation of the following artists who have built practices in various media and who share a strong interest in, and affinity with the issues that shape this work. They are: Lynn Acoose, Cheryl L'Hirondelle, Joseph Naytowhow, Greg Daniels, Elvina Piapot, Sheila Urbanoski, Sylvain Carette, Mark Schmidt, Russell Wallace and myself. Important contributions were also made by Richard Agecoutay, Anthony Dieter and Chris Kubick. Isi-pîkiskwêwin-Ayapihkêsîsak owes a debt of gratitude to the Canada Council Media Arts Section, the Banff Centre for the Arts, and to many others (especially Faye Heavy Shield, Kokum Piapot, Buffy Sainte Marie and the Aboriginal Film and Video Art Alliance) for their inspiration and support.

  abstract = {ÐPrincipal curves have been defined as ªself-consistentº smooth curves which pass through the ªmiddleº of a d-dimensional probability distribution or data cloud. They give a summary of the data and also serve as an efficient feature extraction tool. We take a new approach by defining principal curves as continuous curves of a given length which minimize the expected squared distance between the curve and points of the space randomly chosen according to a given distribution. The new definition makes it possible to theoretically analyze principal curve learning from training data and it also leads to a new practical construction. Our theoretical learning scheme chooses a curve from a class of polygonal lines with k segments and with a given total length to minimize the average squared distance over n training points drawn independently. Convergence properties of this learning scheme are analyzed and a practical version of this theoretical algorithm is implemented. In each iteration of the algorithm, a new vertex is added to the polygonal line and the positions of the vertices are updated so that they minimize a penalized squared distance criterion. Simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm compares favorably with previous methods, both in terms of performance and computational complexity, and is more robust to varying data models.},

Simplicial complexes may be constructed from undirected or directed graphs (digraphs) in several different ways. Here we consider two of them: the neighborhood and the clique complex. We show how a new branch of topology may be introduced which we call statistical mechanics of simplicial complexes.},

If you struggle also with this because of your color blindness, Color Name \& Hue might help you. Try it out. With this little tool you can either enter RGB (Red-Green-Blue) values, HSB (Hue-Saturation-Brightness) numbers or a hexadecimal code for a color, to find its closest match of a named color and its corresponding hue. It is also possible to just use the sliders to see how color hues are changing. The list of colors comprises 1640 different color names extracted from several sources on the web. The color name is matched to one of the following main color hues: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, Brown, Black, Grey, and White. I always wanted to have such a tool because it’s fascinating for me to see matching color hues of colors I just can’t categorize. Finally I was inspired by Chirag Mehta and his tool Name that Color. Many thanks to him. Color Name \& Hue is just a little extension to his work. But nevertheless it took me a lot of time to match all those colors to their corresponding main color hues. Thanks Chirag Mehta for Name that Color and letting us use his JavaScript code. John Dyer for his Photoshop like JavaScript Color Picker My wife. She has my not-colorblind eyes. I tried to check the color hues as good as possible. Of course one can argue about certain colors and their main hue. So please be a little bit generous when using this tool and don’t rely on it, specially for print colors. If you find some colors which are definitely assigned to the wrong hue just add a remark in the comments section and I will correct it in the list of colors.},

Using affect theory and psychoanalytic critique, I will examine and articulate the complex, sometimes painful, and undoubtedly generative ways that Scientology's doctrine and routine practices contributed to my sense of agency as a child -- both in the context of the community and in relation to the outside world.

  abstract = {Abstract: It is rare for a powerful institution to ritualise an apology for historic abuses of power. At Crossbones Graveyard, each Mary Magdalene day, this happens. This paper is an insider view of the spirituality of these Abram-Pagans in contemporary Southwark -- a spirituality couched in history, psychogeography, and ritual poetry. Shelly Rambo's trauma theology helps to elucidate in three ways: death in life, memory as witness, and the pneumatology of Holy Saturday as an inclusion of what is cast out. Crossbones is based on soteriological scandal -- that the bishop who had licenced the sex workers of the High Middle Ages would bury these his business partners in unconsecrated, yet church-owned soil, destined, by medieval psychogeography, for damnation and hell. The eschatological empowerment comes in the perlocutionary power of the poems found within its central metamodern contratext, The Southwark Mysteries, channelled in 1996 from a local spirit, the Winchester Goose.{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}Presenter bio: As the son of both a priest and a witch, Mark has always been interested in religious intersectionality and syncretism.

Queer Buddhists of color practice and open up disidentification with American Buddhism, a concept developed by queer theorist Jos{\'e} Esteban Mu{\~n}oz which describes how queer people of color recuperate majority culture and bring new life into it for their own survival and thriving. As such, this critical framework promulgates a novel possibility within Buddhist Studies and related fields which incubates a radical transformation in American Buddhism without divesting from its institutions and resources entirely.{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}Presenter bio: Matthew ``Matta'' Zheng (any pronouns) is an MDiv student at HDS from Sacramento, CA.

  abstract = {Abstract: Uses and abuses of power in ``Oro'' fraternity as alternative spirituality among the Egba people of Abeokuta, Ogun state Nigeria has become a phenomenon to grapple with in the ancient city. The paper examines the songs of intimidation and oppression against the female gender who are forbidden to take part in the process of alternative spirituality. The songs are not only targeted to abuse the community females but also used as power to dominate the fragile female gender who are considered second Fido in the Abeokuta society. The paper applies ethnographic and participant observation methods. Secondary data are collected through articles in journal, published books, oral interview and the Internet. The paper finds out that the activities of the ``Oro'' fraternity have gone beyond mere spirituality process to a case of abuse of spiritual power as a channel to intimidate and oppress the community female gender.{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}Presenter bio: Olatunbosun Samuel Adekogbe is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Music, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.

Religion, like the other, is irreducibly other: ambiguous, ubiquitous, and of infinite possibility. Religion's power is derived from its irreducibility. religion and the other create the possibility for experience. Our orientation as ``conquest of'' or ``exposure to'' in the forms of knowledge (power) or truth (goodness), respectively, shape our experience of them. To possess (or ``have'') religion is to treat religion as tool and a totality with the possibility of employing it for totalitarian aims, including the conquest of the other. To seek religion, however, is to treat religion as infinity and be opened to it as the exposure to the other. Thus, religious experience is the experience of the other.

However, during the late 1830s, spiritual forces unleashed as part of an internal religious revival manifested themselves in violent persecution. Among the victims was Richard McNemar, a leading light in the Kentucky Revival and prominent convert to Shakerism in 1805. McNemar was the indispensable man in the spread of Shakerism throughout Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana, from his conversion through the 1830s. However, rather than retirement and peace, at the end of his life he was subjected to public humiliation in the name of the sect's founder Mother Ann Lee. After an extended period of suffering, this persecution resulted in McNemar's death.

The purpose of this research is to advance open-hearted dialogue between people who have interest in alternative spiritualities in relation to the use and abuse of power. It, therefore, responds to questions such as: what are the most significant ways in which alternative spiritualities can cause harm through the abuse of power? Are certain spiritual practices inherently abusive? How does sorcery within the African religious perspective constitute an abuse of spiritual power? To respond to these questions, it discussed the categorization of power within the African worldview, with the intention of showing how these powers have been and can be used. It further discussed the enduring features of sorcery and how sorcery remains a practice that abuses spiritual power. The Igwebuike theoretical framework was employed given the peculiar interconnected nature of the African universe. The hermeneutic, critical and analytical methods of inquiry were also used. The study revealed that sorcery is inherently abusive in its use of spiritual power, especially in an African world that understands reality as interconnected and interrelated.{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}Presenter bio: Ikechukwu Anthony Kanu, PhD is a Professor of African Philosophy and Theology, Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies, Tansian University, Nigeria and the Faculty of Catholic Theology and Orthodox Studies, The University of America, Temecula, USA.

  abstract = {Abstract: This presentation explores the role that Tarot practice, as an alternative spirituality, can play in healing and imagining for queer practitioners. Bringing together scholarship from queer theory, temporal studies, and religious affect theory with two firsthand Tarot reading experiences as case-studies, this paper argues for the presence of a unique environment evoked by Tarot where the queer practitioner is able to negotiate pasts, presents, and futures simultaneously. This process, which involves both the semiotics of Tarot cards themselves and the discourse taking place within a reading, ultimately, is both freeing and healing for the queer subject.{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}Presenter bio: Destiny Magnett is a first-year MTS candidate at Harvard Divinity School, with an area of focus in religion, ethics, and politics.

This is created to alleviate common physical discomfort and pain of female practitioners and empower them.

The second theme to be addressed is the paradox of how the depth of surrender required in extreme spiritual pursuit is both essential to the transformative work and exactly what makes us susceptible to abuses of spiritual authority.

  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  abstract = {Abstract: When science-based, physics-based or naturalist-based education is reflexively maligned as inadequate for any reason in comparison to faith-based traditional or alternative spirituality approaches, then a vacuum forms where self-proclaimed authorities rush in. Abuse is available so long as internal pressure is applied to maintain collective faith-based ignorance. The necessary steps of suspension of reason, submission to authority, acceptance of tradition, and a-priori assertion of the separation of body and spirit alianates adherents from rational practices that might inoculate them against physical, emotional and intellectual abuses. But there is a universal cosmology within reach, one that embraces the scope of human understanding of the universe, our solar system, planet, biology, genetics and physical as well as cultural evolution. This 60-minute interactive presentation by artist and naturalist Enrique Rosado will discuss elements of a comprehensive naturalist-based robust cosmology that function as a framework individuals may use to further build conceptual structures to protect themselves from abuse. Borrowing from nature, physics and biology, Rosado will weave together concepts such as the speed of light, the flow of energy, genetic evolution, space/time and the Big Bang that offer a deep sense of interconnectedness with all of life, something that religion proclaims to do. For example, all of the hydrogen in our solar system --- the icy rings of Saturn and frozen balls of ice floating around, and any water or ice on the other planets or their moons along with the hydrogen that fuels every star in the sky can be traced back to the Big Bang. By mass, our bodies are comprised of 10\% hydrogen - we are ancient beings. Over the past 13.6 billion years, this primordial hydrogen may have been waylaid on a star (or two or more) that ran out of usable fuel, collapsed, blew up and spewed out into the universe its remaining hydrogen fuel along with tons of other processed elements and metals - which we colloquially call ``star dust'' - the stuff animals, plants and all humans are made of. This knowledge, this relatedness might motivate us to be kind to our hydrogen related family. We share a common origin and common source of energy.{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}Presenter bio: Enrique Rosado explores humans' relationship with nature through technology, 3-dimensional design, sculpture and philosophy.

Initially a scholarly misnomer predicated on a romanticization of the ``primitive,'' Shamanism has evolved to be a culturally appropriated term that continues to harm Indigenous communities. To what degree is the harm twofold -- both misapplied and then appropriated? How do we wrestle with Indigenous ownership of the moniker ``Shamanism'' by Indigenous peoples far from the term's home context? How can we best move forward with the aspirational dynamic of validating and legitimizing alternative spiritualities when the term Shamanism remains so acutely harmful?{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}Presenter bio: Eric D.

  abstract = {Abstract: This paper examines the potential role of Islamic scholars in preventing harmful practices within fanatical, so-called Islamic groups. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, the paper argues that Islamic scholars can play a critical role in countering extremist ideologies, promoting healthy, ethical, and safe spiritual practices, and providing guidance and support to individuals and communities affected by radicalization. The paper first explores the nature of passionate so-called Islamic groups, including how these groups use distorted interpretations of Islamic teachings to justify violence, extremism, and harmful practices. The paper then considers the challenges associated with countering such groups, including the need to address both the root causes and the symptoms of extremism. The research discusses that Islamic scholars are uniquely positioned to address these challenges, given their deep knowledge of Islamic theology, ethics, and jurisprudence. Islamic scholars can provide a critical counter-narrative to extremist ideologies, promote a more nuanced and balanced understanding of Islamic teachings, and help individuals and communities affected by radicalization find alternative sources of spiritual guidance and support. The article also draws on case studies from various contexts to illustrate the potential role of Islamic scholars in preventing harmful practices within fanatical so-called Islamic groups. These case studies include examples of Islamic scholars working on challenging extremist ideologies, providing counseling and support to individuals affected by radicalization, and providing education and training to community leaders to help prevent the spread of harmful practices. The study also concludes by emphasizing the need for continued research and collaboration between Islamic scholars, community leaders, and other stakeholders to address extremism's complex and ongoing challenge.{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}Presenter bios: Dr. A H M Ershad Uddin is a Lecturer in the Department of Basic Islamic Sciences at Kocaeli University (email: ahmershad86@gmail.com / ahmeu2022@gmail.com).

This spiritual movement mixes New Age elements --taken from Orientalist traditions-- with Catholic figures, especially Virgin Mary. We start from a series of questions: What is the reason for the participation of a female majority within the movement? What are the conditions that lead these women to approach the spiritual world, its wisdom and techniques? What models of femininity do they elaborate and express? Finally, what are the transformations that these practitioners experience at a subjective and intersubjective level during this path?{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}Presenter bio: Agustina Gracia holds a PhD and a bachelor's degree in Anthropology by the University of Buenos Aires.

The paper narrates gurus' and devotees' recollections of their first interaction and analyses the internal discourse over the question of who is responsible for the devotees' kaly{\=a}{\d n} (well-being). It argues that for the newcomers to move forward to the next stage of becoming full-time community members, they need to adopt the gurus' point of view, that is, to see themselves as active, responsible individuals with an enhanced agency that can even challenge social norms, and not as needy, passive individuals who have the least control over their lives.{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}Presenter bio: Michal Erlich is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of East Asian Studies at Tel Aviv University.

For the Santals, it was a holy war to establish a new social order of their own kingdom where they would be able to reinvent their ancient golden past without any intervention from colonial rulers and alien administration. The religious interpretations of the leaders reinforced such views. The leaders, Seedo and Kanhu, declared that they had been appointed as the new kings of their new kingdom by their supreme God. Indeed, they styled themselves as the true emissary of God. The religious beliefs determined every aspect of the life of the Santals. Even the social and political structure of the society was influenced by religious beliefs. Therefore, the concept of the incarnation was easily recognized by the masses. Religious interpretation about the mode of rebellion made Seedo and Kanhu undisputed leaders and their orders were regarded as oracles to the Santals, unfortunately, it proved fatal to the women of the Santal society.{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}br{\textquestiondown}Presenter bio: Dr. Ata Mallick, is presently serving in the capacity of Assistant Professor; Department of History, Dr. B.

Over time, tremendous knowledge accumulated about the power of plants and fungi to heal and nourish. But in recent times as food sources became centralized, more people citified, wisewoman healers were persecuted and indigenous communities were torn apart through colonization, much of this common knowledge was lost. Now, many are seeking to reclaim traditional herbalism, but most flora and fungi harvested for an ever-growing wellness industry and big pharma is done at the expense of Earth. This is a glaring contradiction, since our health is dependent on the health of the environment. This talk and workshop by author, herbalist and naturalist, Vanessa Chakour will explore endangered medicine such as chaga, goldenseal, and American ginseng while touching on the imbalance of power caused by separation from traditional cultures and ancestral healing traditions.

Ayahuasca may cause harm, even though the plants are prescribed and used with the intention of healing or transformation.

  abstract = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have gained considerable attention recently from both academia and industry. In fact, incorporating graph technology and the copious of various graph datasets have led the research community to build sophisticated graph analytics tools. Therefore, the application of KGs has extended to tackle a plethora of real-life problems in dissimilar domains. Despite the abundance of the currently proliferated generic KGs, there is a vital need to construct domain-specific KGs. Further, quality and credibility should be assimilated in the process of constructing and augmenting KGs, particularly those propagated from mixed-quality resources such as social media data. This paper presents a novel credibility domain-based KG Embedding framework. This framework involves capturing a fusion of data obtained from heterogeneous resources into a formal KG representation depicted by a domain ontology. The proposed approach makes use of various knowledge-based repositories to enrich the semantics of the textual contents, thereby facilitating the interoperability of information. The proposed framework also embodies a credibility module to ensure data quality and trustworthiness. The constructed KG is then embedded in a low-dimension semantically-continuous space using several embedding techniques. The utility of the constructed KG and its embeddings is demonstrated and substantiated on link prediction, clustering, and visualisation tasks.},

One such tool is persistent homology, which provides a multiscale description of the homological features within a dataset. A useful representation of this homological information is a persistence diagram (PD). Efforts have been made to map PDs into spaces with additional structure valuable to machine learning tasks. We convert a PD to a finite-dimensional vector representation which we call a persistence image (PI), and prove the stability of this transformation with respect to small perturbations in the inputs. The discriminatory power of PIs is compared against existing methods, showing significant performance gains. We explore the use of PIs with vector-based machine learning tools, such as linear sparse support vector machines, which identify features containing discriminating topological information. Finally, high accuracy inference of parameter values from the dynamic output of a discrete dynamical system (the linked twist map) and a partial differential equation (the anisotropic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation) provide a novel application of the discriminatory power of PIs.},

Data for the study were drawn from Nigeria's Heart of Africa nation branding campaign. The study applies the discoursehistorical approach (DHA) pioneered by Ruth Wodak of the Vienna School of CDA. DHA attempts to integrate much available knowledge about the historical sources and the background of the social and political fields in which discursive events are embedded. Further applying Reisigl and Wodak's presentation of the discursive strategies normally oriented towards understanding texts related to nations and national identities, among others, the study reveals that in appropriating the semiotic resources in the campaign, the discourse producers have predilection for the discursive strategies of mitigating negative attributes which the out-group intensifies, and highlighting positive attributes which the out-group seemingly under-reports in its representations of Nigeria. Notwithstanding the rhetorical dynamics of the semiotic resources, the study concludes that enduring national image management thrives on creating new images and associations lived by a country's citizens rather than tries to refute old ones.},

  abstract = {When designers try to create lasting change in the public sector, their aim is not only to co-design meaningful new or improved services, but also to embed the capacity -- rather than dependency -- of co-design into the organization. Current research suggests that this embedded co-design capacity allows for ongoing transformation. Organizational change can be achieved in various ways, one of which is by facilitating experiential capacity-building programs that immerse public employees in codesigning methods and approaches over the course of several months. In this context, designers often experience that the existing organizational culture strongly constrains the adoption and application of new ways of working. However, many designers are not trained to address this cultural phenomenon. Through a systems oriented design (SOD) approach, two cases of capacity building programs from different countries were analyzed, Fifth Space in Canada and Experimenta in Chile. An integrated research approach combining methods, such as research by design, gigamapping, interviews, and literature mapping was used to get new insights into the complex, contemporary design practice of nurturing and spreading organizational co-design capacities. The analysis of both programs drew my attention to the liminal space between the pre-existing culture in the organization and the emerging culture related to the introduction of new methods and ways of working. While it seemed like these conflicting cultures prohibited lasting innovation, there was also a lack of models and reflective tools toexamine these intercultural dynamics. This thesis presents analytical and conceptual models that help to make interactions between the emerging and existing organizational culture more explicit and actionable. First, the Ripppling model provides three analytical dimensions -- paradigm, practices, and the physical dimension to analyze the interactions between the emerging and dominant organizational cultures. This analysis can help to position the emerging culture in a constructive way without alienating the dominant culture, and to enable the co-existence of both for long-lasting transformational change. The Ripppling ecosystem model builds on the micro-interactions analyzed with the Ripppling model and proposes a system of embedded layers for large-scale cultural change processes that can have effects beyond the organization that participates in the capacity-building program. Taken together, the results of this thesis help to explain the difficulties public organizations face when introducing new capacities, such as codesign. My work suggests that these new capacities function as carriers orvehicles of cultural meaning that will inherently generate productive or unproductive tensions with the pre-existing culture. Therefore, one has to carefully recognize and address the underlying interactions across cultures to build organizational transformation strategically and to leverage the full potential of co-designing approaches. This work gives new insights into how to create continuous change in the public sector and has implications for future design practice, research, and education},

  abstract = {Toroidal moments in artificial media have received growing attention and considered as a promising framework for initiating novel approaches to manage intrinsic radiative losses in nanophotonic and plasmonic systems. In the past decade, there has been substantial attention on the characteristics and excitation methods of toroidal multipoles---in particular, toroidal dipole---in 3D bulk and planar metaplatforms. The remarkable advantages of toroidal resonances have thrust the toroidal metasurface technology from relative anonymity into the limelight, in which researchers have recently centered on developing applied optical and optoelectronic subwavelength devices based on toroidal metaphotonics and metaplasmonics. In this focused contribution, the key principles of 3D and flatland toroidal metastructures are described, and the revolutionary tools that have been implemented based on this topology are briefly highlighted. Infrared photodetectors, immunobiosensors, ultraviolet beam sources, waveguides, and functional modulators are some of the fundamental and latest examples of toroidal metadevices that have been introduced and studied experimentally so far. The possibility of the realization of strong plexciton dynamics and pronounced vacuum Rabi oscillations in toroidal plasmonic metasurfaces are also presented in this review. Ultimate efficient extreme-subwavelength scale devices, such as low-threshold lasers and ultrafast switches, are thus in prospect.},

  abstract = {From social science to biology, numerous applications often rely on graphlets for intuitive and meaningful characterization of networks at both the global macro-level as well as the local micro-level. While graphlets have witnessed a tremendous success and impact in a variety of domains, there has yet to be a fast and efficient approach for computing the frequencies of these subgraph patterns. However, existing methods are not scalable to large networks with millions of nodes and edges, which impedes the application of graphlets to new problems that require large-scale network analysis. To address these problems, we propose a fast, efficient, and parallel algorithm for counting graphlets of size k=3,4-nodes that take only a fraction of the time to compute when compared with the current methods used. The proposed graphlet counting algorithms leverages a number of proven combinatorial arguments for different graphlets. For each edge, we count a few graphlets, and with these counts along with the combinatorial arguments, we obtain the exact counts of others in constant time. On a large collection of 300+ networks from a variety of domains, our graphlet counting strategies are on average 460x faster than current methods. This brings new opportunities to investigate the use of graphlets on much larger networks and newer applications as we show in the experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the largest graphlet computations to date as well as the largest systematic investigation on over 300+ networks from a variety of domains.},

  abstract = {Information networks are becoming increasingly popular to capture complex relationships across various disciplines, such as social networks, citation networks, and biological networks. The primary challenge in this domain is measuring similarity or distance between networks based on topology. However, classical graph-theoretic measures are usually local and mainly based on differences between either node or edge measurements or correlations without considering the topology of networks such as the connected components or holes. In recent years, mathematical tools and deep learning based methods have become popular to extract the topological features of networks. Persistent homology (PH) is a mathematical tool in computational topology that measures the topological features of data that persist across multiple scales with applications ranging from biological networks to social networks. In this paper, we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of using PH on complex network science. We give a brief mathematical background on PH, review different methods (i.e. filtrations) to define PH on networks and highlight different algorithms and applications where PH is used in solving network mining problems. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches and emphasize major conceptual distinctions. We conclude with directions for future work. We focus our review on recent approaches that get significant attention in the mathematics and data mining communities working on network data. We believe our summary of the analysis of PH on networks will provide important insights to researchers in applied network science.},

  abstract = {This paper extends earlier work by its authors on formal aspects of the processes of contracting a theory to eliminate a proposition and revising a theory to introduce a proposition. In the course of the earlier work, G{\"a}rdenfors developed general postulates of a more or less equational nature for such processes, whilst Alchourr{\'o}n and Makinson studied the particular case of contraction functions that are maximal, in the sense of yielding a maximal subset of the theory (or alternatively, of one of its axiomatic bases), that fails to imply the proposition being eliminated. In the present paper, the authors study a broader class, including contraction functions that may be less than maximal. Specifically, they investigate ``partial meet contraction functions'', which are defined to yield the intersection of some nonempty family of maximal subsets of the theory that fail to imply the proposition being eliminated. Basic properties of these functions are established: it is shown in particular that they satisfy the G{\"a}rdenfors postulates, and moreover that they are sufficiently general to provide a representation theorem for those postulates. Some special classes of partial meet contraction functions, notably those that are ``relational'' and ``transitively relational'', are studied in detail, and their connections with certain ``supplementary postulates'' of G{\`a}rdenfors investigated, with a further representation theorem established.},

  abstract = {Diverse, severe, and location-specific impacts on agricultural production are anticipated with climate change. The last IPCC report indicates that the rise of CO 2 and associated " greenhouse " gases could lead to a 1.4 to 5.8 {$^\circ$}C increase in global surface temperatures, with subsequent consequences on precipitation frequency and amounts. Temperature and water availability remain key factors in determining crop growth and productivity; predicted changes in these factors will lead to reduced crop yields. Climate-induced changes in insect pest, pathogen and weed population dynamics and in-vasiveness could compound such effects. Undoubtedly, climate-and weather-induced instability will affect levels of and access to food supply, altering social and economic stability and regional competiveness. Adaptation is considered a key factor that will shape the future severity of climate change impacts on food production. Changes that will not radically modify the monoculture nature of dominant agroecosystems may moderate negative impacts temporarily. The biggest and most durable benefits will likely result from more radical ag-roecological measures that will strengthen the resilience of farmers and rural communities, such as diversification of agroecosytems in the form of polycultures, agroforestry systems , and crop-livestock mixed systems accompanied by organic soil management, water conservation and harvesting, and general enhancement of agrobiodiversity. Traditional farming systems are repositories of a wealth of principles and measures that can help modern agricultural systems become more resilient to climatic extremes. Many of these ag-roecological strategies that reduce vulnerabilities to climate variability include crop diversification, maintaining local genetic diversity, animal integration, soil organic management, water conservation and harvesting, etc. Understanding the ag-roecological features that underlie the resilience of traditional agroecosystems is an urgent matter, as they can serve as the foundation for the design of adapted agricultural systems. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events (hurricanes and droughts) in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to farms with increased levels of biodiversity. Field surveys and results reported in the literature suggest that agroecosystems are more resilient when inserted in a complex landscape matrix, featuring adapted local germplasm deployed in diversified cropping systems managed with organic matter rich soils and water conservation-harvesting techniques. The identification of systems that have withstood climatic events recently or in the past and understanding the agroecological features of such systems that allowed them to resist and/or recover from extreme events is of increased urgency , as the derived resiliency principles and practices that underlie successful farms can be disseminated to thousands of farmers via Campesino a Campesino networks to scale up agroecological practices that enhance the resiliency of agroecosystems. The effective diffusion of agroecological technologies will largely determine how well and how fast farmers adapt to climate change.},

  abstract = {Shape is data and data is shape. Biologists are accustomed to thinking about how the shape of biomolecules, cells, tissues, and organisms arise from the effects of genetics, development, and the environment. Less often do we consider that data itself has shape and structure, or that it is possible to measure the shape of data and analyze it. Here, we review applications of topological data analysis (TDA) to biology in a way accessible to biologists and applied mathematicians alike. TDA uses principles from algebraic topology to comprehensively measure shape in data sets. Using a function that relates the similarity of data points to each other, we can monitor the evolution of topological features---connected components, loops, and voids. This evolution, a topological signature, concisely summarizes large, complex data sets. We first provide a TDA primer for biologists before exploring the use of TDA across biological sub-disciplines, spanning structural biology, molecular biology, evolution, and development. We end by comparing and contrasting different TDA approaches and the potential for their use in biology. The vision of TDA, that data are shape and shape is data, will be relevant as biology transitions into a data-driven era where the meaningful interpretation of large data sets is a limiting factor.},

  abstract = {EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  People around the world increasingly rely on rechargeable batteries to power their mobile phones, tablets, laptop computers and other portable electronic devices. The growing global market for portable electronic devices and rechargeable batteries is driving the growing demand for the extraction of cobalt, a key component in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries.  More than half of the world's total supply of cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). According to the government's own estimates, 20\% of the cobalt currently exported from the DRC comes from artisanal miners in the southern part of the country. There are approximately 110,000 to 150,000 artisanal miners in this region, who work alongside much larger industrial operations. These artisanal miners, referred to as creuseurs in the DRC, mine by hand using the most basic tools to dig out rocks from tunnels deep underground. Artisanal miners include children as young as seven who scavenge for rocks containing cobalt in the discarded by-products of industrial mines, and who wash and sort the ore before it is sold.  This report, jointly researched by Amnesty International and African Resources Watch (Afrewatch), examines the conditions under which artisanal miners extract a significant proportion of the world's cobalt supply, and then traces how this mineral is traded. It is the first comprehensive account of how cobalt from the DRC's artisanal mines enters the supply chain of multinational companies, including some of the world's wealthiest electronics companies. The report assesses the extent to which companies have put in place human rights due diligence measures to know where the cobalt in their products comes from and the conditions under which it is extracted and traded.},

  abstract = {One of the principal assumptions behind the launching of this new journal is that Design can be identified as a subject in its own right, independent of the various areas in which it is applied to parctical effect. The Editorial Board is therefore proposing to publish a series of papers by leading members of the international `invisible college' of Design Studies, which will aim to establish the theoretical bases for treating Design as a coherent discipline of study in its own right. The questions or issues that these papers are expected to address include: Can design be a discipline in its own right? If so, what are its distinguishing features? (What are the kind of features that distinguish any discipline?) To what questions should the discipline address itself --- in both research and teaching? What methodology does it use? What results --- what applications --- should it be trying to achieve? To start the series we are publishing two contributions by Bruce Archer. The first is a short statement prepared specially for this first issue of Design Studies by Professor Archer, entitled Whatever Became of Design Methodology? The second is an extract from a lecture delivered by Professor Archer at the Manchester Regional Centre for Science and Technology on 7 May 1976, under the title The Three Rs. This latter paper argues not only tha Design should be regarded as a fundamental aspect of education (in no sense a specialized subject) but that Design is (or should be) on a par with and distinct from science and the humanities. Bruce Archer is Professor of Design Research at the Royal College of Art, London, where he is also Chairman of The Faculty of Theoretical Studies, Head of The Department of Design Research and Head of The Design Education Unit. He is a member of The Editorial Advisory Board of Design Studies.},

  abstract = {"The two major schools of thought in Indigenous-Settler relations on the ground, in the courts, in public policy, and in research are resurgence and reconciliation. Resurgence refers to practices of Indigenous self-determination and cultural renewal whereas reconciliation refers to practices of reconciliation between Indigenous and Settler nations, such as nation-with-nation treaty negotiations. Reconciliation also refers to the sustainable reconciliation of both Indigenous and Settler peoples with the living earth as the grounds for both resurgence and Indigenous-Settler reconciliation. Critically and constructively analyzing these two schools from a wide variety of perspectives and lived experiences, this volume connects both discourses to the ecosystem dynamics that animate the living earth. Resurgence and Reconciliation is multi-disciplinary, blending law, political science, political economy, women's studies, ecology, history, anthropology, sustainability, and climate change. Its dialogic approach strives to put these fields in conversation and draw out the connections and tensions between them. By using "earth-teachings" to inform social practices, the editors and contributors offer a rich, innovative, and holistic way forward in response to the world's most profound natural and social challenges. This timely volume shows how the complexities and interconnections of resurgence and reconciliation and the living earth are often overlooked in contemporary discourse and debate."--},

Spacelike and timelike infinity are time-periodic quotients of AdS3. These three components of infinity combine to an S3 represented as a toric fibration over the interval. Privileged scattering states of scalars organize into SL(2, {$\mathbb{R}$})L {\texttimes}SL(2, {$\mathbb{R}$})R conformal primary wave functions and their descendants with real integral or half-integral conformal weights, giving the normally continuous scattering problem a discrete character.},

Although sign theories have along history, Peirce's accounts are distinctive and innovative fortheir breadth and complexity, and for capturing the importance ofinterpretation to signification. For Peirce, developing athoroughgoing theory of signs was a central philosophical andintellectual preoccupation. The importance of semiotic for Peirce iswide ranging. As he himself said, ``[{\dots}] it has never beenin my power to study anything, -- mathematics, ethics, metaphysics,gravitation, thermodynamics, optics, chemistry, comparative anatomy,astronomy, psychology, phonetics, economics, the history of science,whist, men and women, wine, metrology, except as a study ofsemiotic'' (SS 1977, 85--6). Peirce also treated sign theoryas central to his work on logic, as the medium for inquiry and theprocess of scientific discovery, and even as one possible means for`proving' his pragmatism. Its importance in Peirce's philosophy, then,cannot be overestimated., Across the course of his intellectual life, Peirce continuallyreturned to and developed his ideas about signs and semiotic and thereare three broadly delineable accounts: a concise Early Account fromthe 1860s; a complete and relatively neat Interim Account developedthrough the 1880s and 1890s and presented in 1903; and hisspeculative, rambling, and incomplete Final Account developed between1906 and 1910. The following entry examines these three accounts, andtraces the changes that led Peirce to develop earlier accounts andgenerate new, more complex, sign theories. However, despite thesechanges, Peirce's ideas on the basic structure of signs andsignification remain largely uniform throughout his developments.Consequently, it is useful to begin with an account of the basicstructure of signs according to Peirce.},

The envisioned outcome as an interactive installation encourages users to explore, experiment, control and co-create along with generative AI models. This hands-on approach through an installation merging generative storytelling and physical-digital artefacts, aspires to serve as a bridge between the apprehensions surrounding AI and its meaningful integration, shifting the discourse to informed curiosity. The project invites users to be a part of the conversation, encourages critical engagement, and allows users to assess AI's potential within their own realms.},

The mine, to be constructed in the heart of the Kakadu National Park (home to the Mirrar people and a World Heritage site) has been the topic of public debate and controversy involving Aboriginal communities, political parties, the mining industry, and environmentalists. By examining the colonial and anti-colonial discourses that inform the mining project with a particular focus on the colonialist, capitalist discourse inherent in the construction of Australian nationhood and the management of Aboriginal identity, I argue that contemporary postcolonial theory can be problematic in accounting for anticolonialist struggles or the struggles of the colonized to negotiate with and survive colonial conditions. I also examine the differential power dynamics among the different stakeholders in this process. I conclude by discussing implications of this case for stakeholder theory and for critical management studies. 2 Whose Mine is it Anyway?

However, networks are intrinsically limited to describing pairwise interactions, whereas real-world systems are often characterized by higher-order interactions involving groups of three or more units. Higher-order structures, such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes, are therefore a better tool to map the real organization of many social, biological and man-made systems. Here, we highlight recent evidence of collective behaviours induced by higher-order interactions, and we outline three key challenges for the physics of higher-order systems.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithm for the computation of Vietoris--Rips persistence barcodes and describe its implementation in the software Ripser. The method relies on implicit representations of the coboundary operator and the filtration order of the simplices, avoiding the explicit construction and storage of the filtration coboundary matrix. Moreover, it makes use of apparent pairs, a simple but powerful method for constructing a discrete gradient field from a total order on the simplices of a simplicial complex, which is also of independent interest. Our implementation shows substantial improvements over previous software both in time and memory usage.},

The article considers the changing contexts of information communication, with some caveats about the identification of `pathologies of information', and analyses the changes over time in the way in which issues of the quantity and quality of information available have been regarded. Two main classes of problems and issues are discussed. The first comprises issues relating to the quantity and diversity of information available: information overload, information anxiety, etc. The second comprises issues relating to the changing information environment with the advent of Web 2.0: loss of identity and authority, emphasis on micro-chunking and shallow novelty, and the impermanence of information. A final section proposes some means of solution of problems and of improvements to the situation.},

Drawing from Thi Nguyen's theory of agency as an inherent aesthetic of games media, this thesis explores how games may be leveraged as a form of learning-by-doing in a pedagogical setting. This argument is explored through the analysis of existing games, as case studies, and my design prototype of a new augmented reality game, Feast of Proportions. John Law's material semiotics approach is applied to play and learning in order to understand the relationships between the designer, game, and player. The research through Feast of Proportions' design offers reflections on the iterative design of a game for learning and a final product that speaks to potential future for the application of games in education},

  abstract = {In light of the concerted efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) per the so-called Paris Agreement, the Information and Communication Industry (ICT) has received little attention as a significant contributor to GHGE and if anything is often highly praised for enabling efficiencies that help reduce other industry sectors footprint. In this paper, we aim at assessing the global carbon footprint of the overall ICT industry, including the contribution from the main consumer devices, the data centers and communication networks, and compare it with the to the total worldwide GHGE. We conduct a detailed and rigorous analysis of the ICT global carbon footprint, including both the production and the operational energy of ICT devices, as well as the operational energy for the supporting ICT infrastructure. We then compare this contribution to the global 2016-level GHGE. We have found that, if unchecked, ICT GHGE relative contribution could grow from roughly 1--1.6\% in 2007 to exceed 14\% of the 2016-level worldwide GHGE by 2040, accounting for more than half of the current relative contribution of the whole transportation sector. Our study also highlights the contribution of smart phones and shows that by 2020, the footprint of smart phones alone would surpass the individual contribution of desktops, laptops and displays. Finally, we offer some actionable recommendations on how to mitigate and curb the ICT explosive GHGE footprint, through a combination of renewable energy use, tax policies, managerial actions and alternative business models.},

  year = {2003},
  abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

Many networks are known to exhibit rich, lower-order connectivity patterns that can be captured at the level of individual nodes and edges. However, higher-order organization of complex networks---at the level of small network subgraphs---remains largely unknown. Here, we develop a generalized framework for clustering networks on the basis of higher-order connectivity patterns. This framework provides mathematical guarantees on the optimality of obtained clusters and scales to networks with billions of edges. The framework reveals higher-order organization in a number of networks, including information propagation units in neuronal networks and hub structure in transportation networks. Results show that networks exhibit rich higher-order organizational structures that are exposed by clustering based on higher-order connectivity patterns.},

In its investigation of interactions between human cognition and mediating artifacts, this research relies heavily on the resources of cognitive ethnography, including both observation and in-depth interviews with participants. Relevant contributions from the fields of information studies, book history, digital humanities, and human-computer interaction are presented to further elucidate the findings of this study. The findings reveal several emergent, interrelated navigational strategies, such as the use of annotations as navigational aids, reliance on automated interface actions, and the navigational value of interface metaphors. In further addressing the practice of textual navigation, this research also describes the creation of a prototype interface reflecting the study's findings. This research proposes new ways of conceptualizing textual navigation and designing interfaces that support emergent textual interaction.},

  abstract = {Higher-order networks capture the interactions among two or more  nodes and they are raising increasing interest in the study of brain networks. Here we show that higher-order interactions are responsible for new non-linear dynamical processes that cannot be observed in pairwise networks. We reveal how non-linear dynamical processes can be used to learn the topology, by defining Topological Kuramoto model and Topological global synchronization. These critical phenomena  capture the synchronization of topological signals, i.e. dynamical signal defined not only on nodes but also on links, triangles and higher-dimensional simplices in simplicial complexes. Moreover will discuss how the Dirac operator can be used to couple and process topological signal of different dimensions, formulating Dirac signal processing. Finally we will reveal how non-linear dynamics can shape topology by formulating triadic percolation. In triadic percolation triadic interactions can turn percolation into a fully-fledged dynamical process in which nodes can turn on and off intermittently in a periodic fashion or even chaotically leading to period doubling and a route to chaos of the percolation order parameter.  Triadic percolation changes drastically our understanding of percolation and can describe real systems in which the giant component varies significantly in time such as in brain functional networks and in climate.},

Hence, we have sought how to design processes that enable democratic design processes and possibly design for democracy. We have analysed student praxis and project turn-ins produced at a SOD course Design for Democracy at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design (AHO) 2016 --2018. This analysis led to the description of several techniques as dimensions to understand and facilitate processes for - and to design for democracy. These are field- and desktop research, Rich design space, leverage point analysis, ZIP analysis, systemic evaluation, user journey, understanding relationships, GIGA mapping, digital platforms, SOD as sharing, participatory design, co-creation, discussion tool, stakeholder mapping / expert networks, prompting tools, and strategy or synergy map. These techniques are then discussed against theory on democracy to study their effect in relation to SOD as praxis and SOD as a developing process of strategic services for democracy.},

  abstract = {Growing graphs describe a multitude of developing processes from maturing brains to expanding vocabularies to burgeoning public transit systems. Each of these growing processes likely adheres to proliferation rules that establish an effective order of node and connection emergence. When followed, such proliferation rules allow the system to properly develop along a predetermined trajectory. But rules are rarely followed. Here we ask what topological changes in the growing graph trajectories might occur after the specific but basic perturbation of permuting the node emergence order. Specifically we harness applied topological methods to determine which of six growing graph models exhibit topology that is robust to randomizing node order, termed global reorderability, and robust to temporally-local node swaps, termed local reorderability. We find that the six graph models fall upon a spectrum of both local and global reorderability, and furthermore we provide theoretical connections between robustness to node pair ordering and robustness to arbitrary node orderings. Finally we discuss real-world applications of reorderability analyses and suggest possibilities for designing reorderable networks.},

  abstract = {Background Intricate maps of science have been created from citation data to visualize the structure of scientific activity. However, most scientific publications are now accessed online. Scholarly web portals record detailed log data at a scale that exceeds the number of all existing citations combined. Such log data is recorded immediately upon publication and keeps track of the sequences of user requests (clickstreams) that are issued by a variety of users across many different domains. Given these advantages of log datasets over citation data, we investigate whether they can produce high-resolution, more current maps of science. Methodology Over the course of 2007 and 2008, we collected nearly 1 billion user interactions recorded by the scholarly web portals of some of the most significant publishers, aggregators and institutional consortia. The resulting reference data set covers a significant part of world-wide use of scholarly web portals in 2006, and provides a balanced coverage of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. A journal clickstream model, i.e. a first-order Markov chain, was extracted from the sequences of user interactions in the logs. The clickstream model was validated by comparing it to the Getty Research Institute's Architecture and Art Thesaurus. The resulting model was visualized as a journal network that outlines the relationships between various scientific domains and clarifies the connection of the social sciences and humanities to the natural sciences. Conclusions Maps of science resulting from large-scale clickstream data provide a detailed, contemporary view of scientific activity and correct the underrepresentation of the social sciences and humanities that is commonly found in citation data.},

Players Max and Min alternately place chips on the vertices of a graph. When a vertex accumulates as many chips as its degree, it fires, sending one chip to each neighbour; this may in turn cause other vertices to fire. The game ends when vertices continue firing forever. Min seeks to minimize the number of chips played during the game, while Max seeks to maximize it. When both players play optimally, the length of the game is the toppling number of a graph G, and is denoted by t(G). By considering strategies for both players and investigating the evolution of the game with differential equations, we provide asymptotic bounds on the toppling number of the complete graph. In particular, we prove that for sufficiently large n 0.596400 n2 {$<$} t(Kn) {$<$} 0.637152 n2. Using a fractional version of the game, we couple the toppling numbers of complete graphs and the binomial random graph G(n,p). It is shown that for pn {$\geq$}n{$^2$} / {\textsurd} log(n) asymptotically almost surely t(G(n,p))=(1+o(1)) p t(Kn).},

As budgets are slashed and marginal programs are eliminated in the current economic crisis, only the most articulate and productive will survive. Digital collections are proliferating, but most remain difficult to use, and digital scholarship remains a backwater in most humanities departments with respect to hiring, promotion, and teaching practices. Only the scholars themselves are in a position to move the field forward. Experiences of the sciences in their initiatives for cyberinfrastructure and eScience offer valuable lessons. Information- and data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary research is now the norm in the sciences, while remaining experimental in the humanities. Discussed here are six factors for comparison, selected for their implications for the future of digital scholarship in the humanities: publication practices, data, research methods, collaboration, incentives, and learning. Drawing upon lessons gleaned from these comparisons, humanities scholars are ``called to action'' with five questions to address as a community: What are data? What are the infrastructure requirements? Where are the social studies of digital humanities? What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century? What is the value proposition for digital humanities in an era of declining budgets?},

However, the classic Triple Helix (TH) theory does not explicitly deal with SI, and relegates civil society to a passive role. This paper aims to analyze if SI requires an evolution of the TH framework. The methodology is a multi-case study based on SI projects and initiatives in the energy sector.The main findings are that citizens are involved in SI though to various extents: there are SI projects carried out ``for'' citizens, ``with'' citizens, and to a much lesser extent; ``by'' citizens. SI in the energy sector rely also on the commitment of the local government and the presence of social enterprises. Therefore, we suggest that a Quadruple Helix (QH) approach may be necessary for energy-related SI.},

  abstract = {As a philosopher working in the Western tradition I want to think through a problem that arises from the heart of that tradition. Possible solutions to the problem of dualism that come from a materialist monist perspective are sometimes rejected out of a misunderstanding that comes from the sheer depth and resilience of dualist thinking. Using personal experience drawn from Goethean observation, I here set out another way of thinking about materialism. My central claim arises from an essentially simple question. We know that substance dualism (the idea that the world is made up of two types of substance: mind and matter) is fraught with problems, not least of which is the question of how these two substances interact. Moreover, the notion of two substances always seems to bring in its wake an evaluative component, where one substance (for us in the Western tradition: mind) is seen as better than the other substance. Attempts to solve the problem of interaction by creating a form of monism that basically claims that there is, in fact, only one substance have been unnecessarily hampered, I believe, by the idea that the one substance left remaining has to be either like mind or like matter asconceivedby dualism. But why so? If the dualism model is wrong, then why carry over its interpretation of either mind or matter? And if we don't do this, then we are left with a pressing question: what is the real nature of the world and what is my relationship to it? I want to explore this question through my own experience of encountering the world with the guidance of the eighteenth-century poet and scientist, J.W. von Goethe. To do this will involve adopting a certain autobiographical mode. I also want to do this in such a way that the reader could follow the way I have set this out and, should it seem inviting or important enough, test it for themselves with a phenomenon of their choice.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

This paper presents a rationale for the use of museums and art galleries as sites for public health interventions and health promotion programmes through discussing the social role of these organisations in the health and well-being of the communities they serve. Recent research from several countries is reviewed and integrated into a proposed framework for future collaboration between cultural heritage, health-care and university sectors to further advance research, policy development and evidence-based practice.},

The spiritual leader of the internationally based sannyasin religious group, guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, founded Rajneeshpuram as a model of sannyasin community formation. The sannyasin deny the legitimacy of all human institutions, accepting neither any general code of conduct nor any shared system of beliefs. This book is a narrative account of the controversial methods of group formation and control practiced by the sannyasin and of the events that resulted in the violence between the settlement and the surrounding community that led to the group's dissolution. Based on first-hand observation and interviews, the book describes the conditions of life in the settlement and the causes of conflicts both within the community and with outsiders. The author argues that the sannyasin method of group control, relying on confrontation among members, the threat of banishment, and charismatic authority, restricted the sannyasin in resolving conflicts with outsiders for whom these methods of control were ineffectual. The first treatment of the subject informed by sociological scholarship, this study provides unique insight into the importance of shared values in regulating group processes and relationships with other groups.},

While working on commercial projects we often face unusual tasks that require unconventional techniques to get those jobs done. On Entagma we'd like to share the techniques we've been nerding out over and using in production, helping us to create advanced CG animation with a twist. We publish a new video tutorial every second monday. As with our commercial and personal work we'd like to focus on the boundaries between design and advanced CGI. Yes there might be some VFX involved, but always with an eye on aesthetics, communication and -- design. We believe that any complex technology can thrive in the hands of creatives who know how to combine their artistic skills with the ability to leverage the strengths of their tools. That's why we believe it is crucial for the modern designer to be fluent in both fields: Design AND technology. We hope you accompany us on our own learning path and together with us get a better grip of what's possible in advanced 3D. Our goal simply is for you and for us to become better designers.},

  abstract = {Orus Mateo Casta{\~n}o-Su{\'a}rez Ontario College of Art and Design University  Abstract: One of the most valuable parts of this conference on the "Uses and Abuses of Power in Alternative Spiritualities" is the opportunity to nurture peerhoods of critique among alternative spiritual community members and leaders. Scholars play a pivotal role through critique by helping spiritual communities examine, avoid, and heal from harmful practices. It is from this sense of community and urgency that I turn to Foucault's expertise on power, particularly his "Society Must Be Defended" lecture. I posit that like any communities with power, alternative faith communities can become capitalist racist biopolitical corporations. Presenter bio: Orus Mateo Casta{\~n}o-Su{\'a}rez endeavours to engage with as diverse a population of thinkers as possible as a graduate student, spiritual practitioner, artist-curator, software designer, and writer. They curate exhibitions for their artist incubator Collective65 in partnership with a number of Toronto consulates. Their most recent independent show as artist-curator, Torus (2022), was presented in the Great Hall gallery in Canada's largest art and design university, OCADU. As a software designer, Orus is expanding the limits of interdisciplinary data modeling.

  abstract = {In an era where information overload impedes our capacity to address the escalating climate crisis, we are in a crisis of understanding. This thesis introduces novel methods of amplifying human visuospatial ability to analyze text and graphs by using human-in-the-loop computational methods. I propose the WorkSpace platform, which integrates several original contributions, including: semforms (three-dimensional topic model compositions), infomorphs (topological data analysis using graph chunks), and ontological summary graphing (revealing ontological positioning using semantic networks). WorkSpace builds on existing Systemic Design methods to reveal relationships between academic fields by activating text into knowledge across four modes: knowledge surfacing, synthesis, translation, and creation. WorkSpace is a new mode of knowledge activation that fosters the rapid interdisciplinary collaboration essential to addressing wicked problems like global warming.

  abstract = {The capacity to engage in systems thinking is often viewed as being a product of being able to understand complex systems due to one's facility in mastering systems theories, methods, and being able to adeptly reason. Relatively little attention is paid in the systems literature to the processes of learning from experience and creating knowledge as a direct consequence of individuals engaging systems thinking itself over time. In fact, the potential efficacy of systems thinking to improve performance normally seen as only contingent on a priori knowledge, rather than knowledge created via learning from experience. Such newly create knowledge often results from engaging in modeling efforts and systemic forms of inquiry. This article proposes a model for creating new knowledge by coupling systems modeling with a pragmatic approach to knowledge-creation. This approach is based on a foundation of the pragmatic concepts first proposed by the American philosopher/scientist Charles Sanders Peirce over a century ago. This model offers systems practitioners a framework to engage in knowledge-intensive systems thinking (KIST) for addressing complex problematic issues.},

  abstract = {We present a search for new particles decaying to jet pairs using the dijet mass spectrum measured by the CMS detector in pp collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}=8\$ TeV. The data used correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. The dijet mass distribution of the two leading jets is measured after requiring the pseudorapidity separation of the two jets to satisfy \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}eta\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{jj\}\}{\textbar} \&lt; 1.3\$ with each jet inside the region \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}eta{\textbar}\&lt; 2.5\$. The measured dijet mass spectrum is fitted with a smooth, empirical parameterization which well describes the prediction from simulated QCD dijet events. In the current data sample we observe no significant evidence for new particle production. We set upper limits at the 95{\textbackslash}\% confidence level on the resonance cross section. By comparing these generic limits with theoretical predictions for the cross section of several models of new particles, we set specific lower limits on the mass of string resonances, excited quarks, axigluons, colorons, s8 resonances, \${\textbackslash}mbox\{E\}\_\{6\}\$ diquarks, W' and Z' bosons, and Randall-Sundrum gravitons. The lower mass limits reach up to 5.1 TeV, depending on the model, and extend previous exclusions from the dijet mass search technique.},

  abstract = {Wikidata is a well-known collaborative knowledge graph containing multilingual data for hundreds of language locales, ranging from Arabic (ar) to Zulu (zu). As the largest publicly accessible multilingual knowledge graph on the internet, it is important to understand the kinds of entities and the range of multilingual data that exist on Wikidata. However, research on the kinds of subject matters and topics in Wikidata and the distribution of multilingual data in the labels, descriptions, and aliases has been relatively limited. This dissertation presents a suite of tools that apply data profiling, machine learning, and data visualization techniques to Wikidata in order to organize it into subject-matter domains and to identify areas for multilingual data augmentation. After an overview of a similar collaborative knowledge graph, Freebase, is provided, the research outputs are organized as follows. First, we present WikiMetaData Profiler, a data profiling tool where the input is the entire Wikidata data dump and the outputs are (1) a series of datasets containing descriptive statistics on the distribution of items, properties, and language and (2) the raw triples in the Wikidata knowledge graph. The output is presented through interactive dashboards using Google Data Studio. Second, we present WiDAR, or Wikidata i18n Data and Ranging, another suite of tools to (1) implement machine learning techniques and manual processes that identify subject-matter domains in Wikidata, (2) generate data visualizations in the form of heatmaps to help gain a sense of "the lay of the land'' with regards to the distribution of multilingual data, and (3) programmatically generate SPARQL queries that provide recommendations for multilingual data augmentation. Finally, a demonstration with a graph visualization tool and various knowledge graph embedding techniques is presented. The research presented in this dissertation works to advance the Wikidata and research community's understanding and use of Wikidata's data and multilingual aspects.},

Through a series of facilitated virtual meetings, 33 LGBTQ2S+ youth from across Ontario participated in collaborative activities to identify barriers they have experienced when accessing mental health services, as well as potential solutions to these barriers. Discussions were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. The study revealed that LGBTQ2S+ youth disproportionately experience bias, discrimination, and heteronormative assumptions when accessing mental health services, resulting in negative care experiences. Youth also reported insufficient availability of quality care, little continuity in care, and a lack of educated providers capable of effectively addressing the needs of the community. Potential solutions proposed by youth include training resources for providers, LGBTQ2S+ specific care centers, better continuity of care, and assessments to ensure care providers are culturally competent. These results show the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the disparities LGBTQ2S+ youth experience when accessing mental health services and highlight the urgent need to implement policies and programs that will advance the standards of care for LGBTQ2S+ youth.},

Power asymmetries assure the dominance of Apple in price setting and the timing of product delivery, resulting in intense pressures and illegal overtime for workers.

  abstract = {Our perspective on research-creation has connections to recent discussions in the philosophy of method that, to quote John Law (2004), deal with "mess in social sdence research" (p. 2) as well as the "performativity" of research understood as a practice of "enactment" Drawing on Annemarie Mol's (2002) insights into the ontology of medical practice and her notion of "the body multiple," as well as Latour's (2005) re-articulation of the concept of "assemblage," Law (2004) contends that what we commonly refer to as "objects of research" are enacted through performance (p. 55){$\cdot$} Stressing difference and multiplicity, rather than unity, resemblance, representation, or fidelity to the real, Law (2004) also highlights that social science research, and methodology as enactment, is inherently a messy business. The relations between things are uncertain "sometimes vague, difficult and contradictory" (p. 55). The idea of "enactment" is what separates both MoI (2002) and Law (2004) from Latour's (2005) recurrent use of the term "construction." The social is not merely constructed in social science research; it is also presented in the same way that an instrumentalist interprets a musical score, an actor delivers her lines, or a dancer enacts a piece of choreography. In thinking through enactment MoI (2002) writes that "like human subjects, natural objects, are framed as parts of events that occur and plays that are staged. If an object is real this is because it is part of a practice. It is a reality enacted" (p. 44). There is also an ontological dimension to the creation-as-research mode/category. "Creation-as-research" is also "creation-through-research," in terms of expanding what "is" in the world by revealing new layers, permutations of reality, or "experiences to be experienced." This is a funny way of saying what Heidegger explains, also somewhat incomprehensibly, when he argues that our use of things brings out their "thingness," meaning all that "is" (i.e., Being with a capital "B"), can only be brought into greater degrees of "unconcealment" by being employed or deployed in "hands-on" situations, in addition to being analyzed and interpreted (see Heidegger, 1975, 1977). There is also another family resemblance specific to much research-creation that suggests a particular angle worth noting in this regard, based around the concept of "interventioa" Questions such as: "Does/will this project contribute to knowledge?," "In what way?," "What are its identifiable outcomes?" et cetera, can often be usefully elucidated (and potentially challenged) by asking, "On what level(s) can this project be identified as an intervention?" This shifts emphasis away from over-valuing "deliverables" and moves towards dynamic evaluative mechanisms based in conceptions of "peer review" that de-emphasize the significance of quantifiable research outcomes, and focus instead on recognizing the mechanisms, contexts, communities, and methods through which a projed strives to make something happen; in other words, to produce results that are not necessarily material or textual, but that occur on multiple planes, including the reactions of a beholder of a creative work, the future efforts of a community member and/or collaborator affected by the process of bringing a projed to fruition, or the technological results and/or residues. The "ideal" peer reviewer is aware of the stakes at play within a particular intervention, and can reflexively respond to how well or poorly a projed articulates itself vis {\`a} vis those stakes. Criteria such as social, cultural, environmental, or economic benefits, the identifiability of a central research question, the articulation of a conceptual terrain, et cetera, are often completely germane to such assessments. But at other times, aesthetic components, the position and role of an intended audience, or the calling into question of traditional conceptions of knowledge mobilization are more important considerations.},

These visualizations, commonly based on simple attributes such as relative word frequency, have become increasingly popular tools. We extend this direction, presenting the first visualization of document content which combines word frequency with the human-created structure in lexical databases to create a visualization that also reflects semantic content. DocuBurst is a radial, space-filling layout of hyponymy (the IS-A relation), overlaid with occurrence counts of words in a document of interest to provide visual summaries at varying levels of granularity. Interactive document analysis is supported with geometric and semantic zoom, selectable focus on individual words, and linked access to source text.},

My respondents discussed several potential challenges for visualization research in terms of knowledge formation: a lack of rigor in the methods used, a lack of applicability to actual communities of practice, and a lack of theoretical structures that incorporate everything that happens to people and to data both before and after the few seconds when a viewer looks at a value in a chart. Orienting the field around progress (if such a thing is even desirable, which is another point of contention) I believe will require drastic re-conceptions of what the field is, what it values, and how it is taught.},

Yet, the language we use to describe how people can use visualizations to mislead can be relatively sparse. For instance, one can be ``lying with vis'' or using ``deceptive visualizations.'' In this paper, we use the language of computer security to expand the space of ways that unscrupulous people (black hats) can manipulate visualizations for nefarious ends. In addition to forms of deception well-covered in the visualization literature, we also focus on visualizations which have fidelity to the underlying data (and so may not be considered deceptive in the ordinary use of the term in visualization), but still have negative impact on how data are perceived. We encourage designers to think defensively and comprehensively about how their visual designs can result in data being misinterpreted.},

This visual inspection is particularly important in exploratory data analysis, where analysts can use visualizations such as histograms and dot plots to identify data quality issues. Yet, these visualizations are driven by parameters such as histogram bin size or mark opacity that have a great deal of impact on the final visual appearance of the chart, but are rarely optimized to make important features visible. In this paper, we show that data flaws have varying impact on the visual features of visualizations, and that the adversarial or merely uncritical setting of design parameters of visualizations can obscure the visual signatures of these flaws. Drawing on the framework of Algebraic Visualization Design, we present the results of a crowdsourced study showing that common visualization types can appear to reasonably summarize distributional data while hiding large and important flaws such as missing data and extraneous modes. We make use of these results to propose additional best practices for visualizations of distributions for data quality tasks.},

The essays in Pathways of Reconciliation address the themes of reframing, learning and healing, researching, and living. They engage with different approaches to reconciliation (within a variety of reconciliation frameworks, either explicit or implicit) and illustrate the complexities of the reconciliation process itself. They canvass multiple and varied pathways of reconciliation, from Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives, reflecting a diversity of approaches to the mandate given to all Canadians by the TRC with its Calls to Action. Together the authors -- academics, practitioners, students and ordinary citizens -- demonstrate the importance of trying and learning from new and creative approaches to thinking about and practicing reconciliation and reflect on what they have learned from their attempts (both successful and less successful) in the process."--},

How can we make sure that you're designing inclusive and equitable outcomes for all - no matter how big or small the decision? The reality of our society is that any system produces what it was designed to produce (unless a stronger force intervenes). Therefore, if oppression, inequalities, and inequities are designed, they can be redesigned. As we strive for human equity, we have to be able to recognize inequity and have the ability to recognize ourselves as designers who have the power disrupt it. In addition to the practices of social innovation and organizing, some people have started to use creative problem solving processes, such as human-centered design and design thinking, to address human inequities and injustices. However, these methodologies in their current state are not enough to combat these complex human systems.1 At Creative Reaction Lab, we've pioneered a framework called Equity-Centered Community Design (ECCD)2 that acknowledges and utilizes the role of people + systems + power when developing solutions or approaches that impact ``the many'' within different communities. We hope this Field Guide will provide a starting point for you to (1) identify where, how, and why to apply Equity-Centered Community Design, and (2) provide key strategies for thinking like an Equity Designer.},

Body of Aesthetics investigates the multimodality of aesthetic experience, beyond the ocularcentricity of formal aesthetics, to explore the therapeutic potential of aesthetic experiences to combat loneliness. The findings are presented in two parts: (1) a methodology, and (2) a practice. As a methodology, Body of Aesthetics offers a new way to approach curation in the context of care, without being prohibitive or prescriptive. The titular exhibition presents this methodology in practice; serving as a case study, the exhibition demonstrates how curators can support individual and social well-being through aesthetic practices. The Body of Aesthetics exhibition features artists Orus Mateo Casta{\~n}o-Su{\'a}rez and Artemis Han who respond to the injustices faced by the body as it is reduced to a means of production, and through its subjugation by the medical gaze. Each artist addresses a perceived social or political injustice in contemporary mental health diagnosis and treatment, offering avenues for hope. The accompanying catalogue essay examines these themes further, weaving them into a narrative about a being that has struggled over centuries to resolve itself. Torn asunder by the ego of philosophical and medical hegemony, and isolated by oppressive, modifying punctuation, it embarks on a journey to reconcile and reinvent itself, supported by the concerted effort of contemporary philosophers, anthropologists, and medical practitioners who recognize its plight.},

  abstract = {Purpose - By reconstructing the genealogy of digital humanities through examining digital humanities projects and evaluative writings, this paper aims to identify core arguments related to disciplinary transformation and pedagogy in the humanities fields. It also seeks to consider knowledge production and transformation of a general humanistic attitude (the Humanities Program) in relation to digital tools. The paper also seeks to examine its perceived impact on disciplinary development, pedagogy, and forms of digital text. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a literature-based conceptual analysis of distinct and diverse aspects of the enterprise of digital humanities, by identifying their main foci together with implications of these preoccupations within larger discourses. The analysis is grounded in a close reading of 45 exemplary texts published from the 1980s to date, and 14 exemplary projects and initiatives. The analysis highlights several concepts with their underlying assumptions. Findings - The perceived epistemological advantage of digital technology for new forms of reasoning is that community development has produced theoretical frameworks and shaped practical directions. The paper identified three distinct formations characterized by associated digital artifacts: prominent opinion leaders, foundational projects, and document forms (morphs). Research limitations/implications - Research data are not comprehensive. Selected texts and projects are exemplary. The results and findings are relevant for the English-language context and limited by a selective corpus. Originality/value - The paper outlines a historical trajectory of digital humanities and the formative stages of development from the discourses of that evolving field. It also identifies constructions of technological advantage with implications for knowledge production in the writing of humanities scholars. The paper contributes to practitioner awareness of the history of digital humanities practice.},

  abstract = {The consideration of environmental impact and energy efficiency when developing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models has received some traction recently as ML models get bigger. It has been shown to increase the energy efficiency of models without significantly affecting accuracy. We reviewed five recent studies that focus on investigating and refining the energy efficiency of ML systems through numerous models and methods with either software or hardware variations. The first article proposed using the total number of Floating-Point of Operations (FPO) to better measure efficiency without depending on hardware, location, and AI approaches used in the model. The second article evaluated and compared two deep learning frameworks, Pytorch and Tensorflow, and how each has its strengths and weaknesses regarding its efficiency in the training phase versus the inference phase. The third article analyzed energy-efficient architectures for ML, which includes utilizing more approximation to increase efficiency while having a minimal effect on accuracy significantly. The fourth article focused on holistic architecture solutions for creating efficient run times and energy consumption of neural networks. The last article developed a Java tool to help with increasing energy efficiency on edges with minimal decrease in accuracy. Lastly, we touched on foundation models and their energy efficiency considerations.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses a wider range of agents in responsive wood performance problematique. This is done through an example of prototyped envelope Ray (see Figure 1) that circulates air in dry warm settings and encloses itself in humid and cold micro-climatic conditions (see Figure 2). The envelope is to be applied on semi-interior or unclimatised spaces of a built environment while securing home to various residents (see Figure 3, Figure 7 and Figure 8). The commonly known factors of wood warping are its ambient air relative humidity and temperature. This research claims that the situation can be more complex and that the performance can be co-habited, co-lived, co-designed and co-created with more abiotic and biotic agents. This involves life preferences and social agendas across the species of the biotic part. This co-creative design process that has over-evolving results leads me to ratification of a new design field: Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance.},

  abstract = {The old garden of log-house Zvona{\v r}ka with adjacent Nusle Stairs is Prague's nature like bio-tope with remarkable diversity and together with the adjacent railway, parks and gardens generates rare bio-corridor within the city centre. As it is located in one of the most expensive residential areas, the pressure on its building development is high. In 2011 a large apartment-complex design was submitted for permit, arguing for keeping the greenery character due to its green roofs (RH-Arch, 2011). Neither previous, nor recently proposed metropolitan plan lists the area for protection (Institute of Planning and Development Prague, 2016). From the personal conversation with its creators, the Institute of Planning and Development Prague has its interest in increasing city's density, not extending its bio-corridors and bio-diversity. The plan is neither co-designed with ecologists nor with local communities or NGOs. It is created purely by urbanists, marking the areas in the plan from the table. As also confirmed by the Concept of Metropolitan Plan Justification, the plan does not consider ``details`` (Kube{\v s} et al., 2014). It also states that for the reason of being behind the range of land planning, the design is not done in respect of European Commission's strategy of Green Infrastructure (European Commission, 2010), but instead, the term Landscape Infrastructure is used (Kube{\v s} et al., 2014). This term is not respecting the complexity of the strategy. First author's architectural NGO Collaborative Collective (Collaborative Collective, 2012, 2016) fixed through cooperation with second author's ecology support and evaluation focused NGO CooLAND (CooLAND, 2016a, 2016b) first ecological pre-study (Z{\'i}mov{\'a}, 2016) for reasoning its relevance, building on and submitting detailed investigation for funding. Figure 2: An Action Diagram Showing an Integration of Local Community, NGOs, Academy and Sponsors for Future Co-Design and Co-Living (Davidov{\'a} 2017) Within spring semester 2017 a fully transdisciplinary systems oriented co-design studio course will be led by Collaborative Collective and CooLAND among the Faculty of Art and Architecture at TU of Liberec (architectural and environmental design students), the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences (forestry and wood engineering students) and Faculty of Living Environment (ecology students), both at the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, the Faculty of Humanities Studies at the Charles University (students of social and cultural ecology), local community and the local environment. This `GIGA-mapping' (Sevaldson, 2011, 2015) and `full scale realisation prototyping studio' (Davidov{\'a} \& Sevaldson, 2016) will focus on supporting the local bio-tope by building shelters for habitat of i.e. bats, insects or homeless people. The design process, prototyping and further local development will fully engage local specific environment together with the local community. In this sense it is not only participation but co-design . Here the co-design method involves both, biotic and abiotic agents within so called `Time Based Design' investigated by Sevaldson (Sevaldson, 2004, 2005, 2017) where the project does not end by the building finalisation. This project is to motivate humans to co-live with other species and among each other across the social differences. The common events such as honey harvest from planned bee-hives should support the eco-system through `urban prototypical interventions' (Davidov{\'a}, 2004; Doherty, 2005). This `non-anthropocentric architecture' (Hensel, 2013, 2015) was concluded by first author's previous study on performance to be at the end also most beneficial for humans (Davidov{\'a}, 2016). It is therefore alarming that though the UN agenda for 2030 sustainable development is calling for collaborative partnership of all stakeholders and fight of poverty while being determined to ensure that economic, social and technological progress occurs in harmony with nature to reach prosperity (United Nations, 2015), its goals are so anthropocentric, that `Cities and Communities' are discussed in separate goal (United Nations, 2015, 2016a) from bio-diversity, discussed in `Life on Land' goal (United Nations, 2015, 2016b). These goals are not in any sense cross-referenced. As opposed to this human-centred approach, this project is to demonstrate the relevance of consideration of human settlements as being part of overall eco-system. Through generating public awareness and pride for the local specificity and community, we believe the bio-corridor will be marked into Metropolitan Plan and no future building development in the precious garden will be enabled. Through this `Ecological Urbanism' that involves `anticipation, sensing, curation, collaboration, production, interaction, mobilisation, measures, adaptation and incubation'(Mostafavi \& Doherty, 2016) , our politics is going from the bottom up!},

  year = {2016},
  abstract = {The paper puts into the context of practical applications my case study research of responsive wood located in Czechia, being inspired by Norwegian and oriental traditional architecture. Approaching the field from a socio-environmental perspective, the article relates human, social and biotic behaviour with climatic and geographical data, addressing interactions in the performance of architectures and its additional issues in urban design. The opportunistic activities, use or habitation of spaces and objects, meets its performance through environment -- material and/or design interactions. The paper claims that, at least in observed climatic locations, semi-interior, or so called non-discrete architecture addressed by Hensel and others, are the grounds for and generators of individualistic and social activities in public and public-private spaces, securing environmental comfort. In this time of increased weather extremes coming with climatic change in certain locations, noise, light pollution, etc., the topic is gaining greater relevance. Inspired by Library of Systemic Relations for GIGA-mapping introduced by Sevaldson (Sevaldson, 2016c), the relationing of such in GIGA-maps required its own coding or update and/or combination of the existing proposed library. The maps are expressing different ranges and intensities of behaviour or performance in relation to placement or designs that are represented by informational layers of images. Relating gradients within (Allen, 2011; Banham, 2009; Michael Hensel \& Menges, 2009; Hight, 2009) and among the fields, thus generating a matrix of interlinked information where zooming, sequencing or feedback looping appears. This way somewhat develops the core ideas of Allen from 1997 on matrixes and fields (Allen, 2009). The three thematic GIGAmaps are in fact developed ZIP-analyses (Sevaldson, 2016d) of each other, zooming a problem of the theme's topic. The semi-interior or non-discrete spaces as a climatic, sound, etc. and biotic --including social gradient-are complex interlinkings of outside and inside environments and have implications for activities and forms of life. Therefore, a systemic approach is needed to fully understand it.},

Offering analyses of the successes and setbacks of these efforts to globalize the art world, this innovative volume presents a new and exciting way of considering art in its global contexts. Essays by an international panel of leading scholars and practicing artists assert that what we talk about as `art' is essentially a Western concept, thus any attempts at understanding art in a global framework require a revising of established conceptual definitions. Organized into three sections, this work first reviews the history and theory of the visual arts since 1980 and introduces readers to the emerging area of scholarship that seeks to place contemporary art in a global framework. The second section traces the progression of recent developments in the art world, focusing on the historical and cultural contexts surrounding efforts to globalize the art world and the visual arts in particular global and transnational frameworks. The final section addresses a wide range of key themes in contemporary art, such as the fundamental institutions and ontologies of art practice, and the interactions among art, politics, and the public sphere. A Companion to Contemporary Art in a Global Framework is essential reading for undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, researchers, and general readers interested in exploring global art beyond the traditional Euro-American context.},

Wrightexercised a great influence at a crucial time in American culturallife --- in the 1860s and 70s, when the force of religious pietyand Transcendentalism was waning.  He was a tireless critic ofmetaphysics and the natural theology he believed it served, but he wasalso a discriminating interpreter of principles in science andphilosophy. He wrote little and his influence was exerted by means ofconversation and philosophical discussion with the circle ofintellectuals and academics centered in Cambridge, Mass. from1850--75. This circle included Charles S. Peirce, William James,and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., all of whom acknowledged Wright'sinfluence.[2]},

  abstract = {The ongoing global race for bigger and better artificial intelligence (AI) systems is expected to have a profound societal and environmental impact by altering job markets, disrupting business models, and enabling new governance and societal welfare structures that can affect global consensus for climate action pathways. However, the current AI systems are trained on biased datasets that could destabilize political agencies impacting climate change mitigation and adaptation decisions and compromise social stability, potentially leading to societal tipping events. Thus, the appropriate design of a less biased AI system that reflects both direct and indirect effects on societies and planetary challenges is a question of paramount importance. In this paper, we tackle the question of data-centric knowledge generation for climate action in ways that minimize biased AI. We argue for the need to co-align a less biased AI with an epistemic web on planetary health challenges for more trustworthy decision-making. A human-in-the-loop AI can be designed to align with three goals. First, it can contribute to a planetary epistemic web that supports climate action. Second, it can directly enable mitigation and adaptation interventions through knowledge of social tipping elements. Finally, it can reduce the data injustices associated with AI pretraining datasets.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

  abstract = {From raw detector activations to reconstructed particles, data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are sparse, irregular, heterogeneous and highly relational in nature. Graph neural networks (GNNs), a class of algorithms belonging to the rapidly growing field of geometric deep learning (GDL), are well suited to tackling such data because GNNs are equipped with relational inductive biases that explicitly make use of localized information encoded in graphs. Furthermore, graphs offer a flexible and efficient alternative to rectilinear structures when representing sparse or irregular data, and can naturally encode heterogeneous information. For these reasons, GNNs have been applied to a number of LHC physics tasks including reconstructing particles from detector readouts and discriminating physics signals against background processes. We introduce and categorize these applications in a manner accessible to both physicists and non-physicists. Our explicit goal is to bridge the gap between the particle physics and GDL communities. After an accessible description of LHC physics, including theory, measurement, simulation and analysis, we overview applications of GNNs at the LHC. We conclude by highlighting technical challenges and future directions that may inspire further collaboration between the physics and GDL communities.},

How to cope with scientific research in design? This paper is motivated by discussions on how to analyze bottom-layer features and the role of design-agents (designers, users, and researchers/semioticians). Focusing on sense attribution to artifacts and consequences thereof that unfold when they are positioned in specific contexts, the concepts of cultural habits and codes have supported our reflections on aesthetic issues in field research. We are delving into how to systematically inquire into habits that lead users to attribute functions to artifacts. As a result, the Trefoil Model have emerged as a theoretical proposal to support the comprehension of semiosic fluxes in development, fruition, and analysis of artifacts, which may foster interplay among design-agents in processes of design of artifacts from a pragmatistic perspective.},

This project has pointed out the trouble with classification and cataloging decisions that are framed as objective and neutral but are always ideological and worked to correct bias in library structures. Viewing knowledge organization systems from a queer perspective, however, challenges the idea that classification and subject language can ever be finally corrected. Engaging queer theory and library classification and cataloging together requires new ways of thinking about how to be ethically and politically engaged on behalf of marginal knowledge formations and identities who quite reasonably expect to be able to locate themselves in the library. Queer theory invites a shift in responsibility from catalogers, positioned to offer functional solutions, to public services librarians, who can teach patrons to dialogically engage the catalog as a complex and biased text, just as critical catalogers do.}

In Speculative Everything, Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby propose a kind of design that is used as a tool to create not only things but ideas. For them, design is a means of speculating about how things could be -- to imagine possible futures. This is not the usual sort of predicting or forecasting, spotting trends and extrapolating; these kinds of predictions have been proven wrong, again and again. Instead, Dunne and Raby pose "what if" questions that are intended to open debate and discussion about the kind of future people want (and do not want). Speculative Everything offers a tour through an emerging cultural landscape of design ideas, ideals, and approaches. Dunne and Raby cite examples from their own design and teaching and from other projects from fine art, design, architecture, cinema, and photography. They also draw on futurology, political theory, the philosophy of technology, and literary fiction. They show us, for example, ideas for a solar kitchen restaurant; a flypaper robotic clock; a menstruation machine; a cloud-seeding truck; a phantom-limb sensation recorder; and devices for food foraging that use the tools of synthetic biology. Dunne and Raby contend that if we speculate more -- about everything -- reality will become more malleable. The ideas freed by speculative design increase the odds of achieving desirable futures.},

  abstract = {Frequently, data in scientific computing is in its abstract form a finite point set in space, and it is sometimes useful or required to compute what one might call the ``shape'' of the set. For that purpose, this article introduces the formal notion of the family of a-shapes of a finite point set in R:{\textasciitilde}. Each shape is a well-defined polytope, derived from the Delaunay triangulation of the point set, with a parameter a l R controlling the desired level of detail. An algorithm is presented that constructs the entire family of shapes for a given set of size n in time 0( nz ), worst case. A robust implementation of the algorithm is discussed, and several applications in the area of scientific computing are mentioned.

  abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

We use a novel technique for visualization of large graphs that evolve through time. Given a dynamic graph, the layout algorithm produces two-dimensional representations of each timeslice, while preserving the mental map of the graph from one slice to the next. A combined view, with all the timeslices can also be viewed and explored. For our analysis we use data from the Association of Computing Machinery's Digital Library of Scientific Literature which contains more than one hundred thousand research papers and authors.

Over the past few decades, historical records have shown an accelerated decline in the availability of resources. Based on national footprint and biocapacity accounts, this analysis aims to advance the forecasting of the G20 countries' ecological footprints over a 30-year time frame. We employed a time series forecasting approach implemented in Python, which included-modular regression (Prophet) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA \& Auto-ARIMA) methods. We evaluated and combined the performance of these three methods. The results indicated that among the largest economies of the G20, only four countries are projected to have a positive ecological footprint balance by 2050. These countries share the common denominator of large land areas and a moderate population growth projection. However, the overall trend of the indicator suggests that it will continue to decline.},

  abstract = {Despite the growing interest in characterizing the local geometry leading to the global topology of networks, our understanding of the local structure of complex networks, especially real-world networks, is still incomplete. Here, we analyze a simple, elegant yet underexplored measure, `degree difference' (DD) between vertices of an edge, to understand the local network geometry. We describe the connection between DD and global assortativity of the network from both formal and conceptual perspective, and show that DD can reveal structural properties that are not obtained from other such measures in network science. Typically, edges with different DD play different structural roles and the DD distribution is an important network signature. Notably, DD is the basic unit of assortativity. We provide an explanation as to why DD can characterize structural heterogeneity in mixing patterns unlike global assortativity and local node assortativity. By analyzing synthetic and real networks, we show that DD distribution can be used to distinguish between different types of networks including those networks that cannot be easily distinguished using degree sequence and global assortativity. Moreover, we show DD to be an indicator for topological robustness of scale-free networks. Overall, DD is a local measure that is simple to define, easy to evaluate, and that reveals structural properties of networks not readily seen from other measures.},

However, since 3D scenes contain partially scanned objects with physical connections, dense placement, changing sizes, and a wide variety of challenging relationships, existing methods perform quite poorly with limited training samples. In this work, we find that the inherently hierarchical structures of physical space in 3D scenes aid in the automatic association of semantic and spatial arrangements, specifying clear patterns and leading to less ambiguous predictions. Thus, they well meet the challenges due to the rich variations within scene categories. To achieve this, we explicitly unify these structural cues of 3D physical spaces into deep neural networks to facilitate scene graph prediction. Specifically, we exploit an external knowledge base as a baseline to accumulate both contextualized visual content and textual facts to form a 3D spatial multimodal knowledge graph. Moreover, we propose a knowledge-enabled scene graph prediction module benefiting from the 3D spatial knowledge to effectively regularize semantic space of relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over current state-of-the-art competitors. Our code is available at https://github.com/HHrEtvP/SMKA.},

We visited 36 self-identified permaculture farms in the continental United States and gathered multidimensional data on the distribution of labor and income across enterprises and seasons, along with sociodemographic information and farm characteristics. Using this data we assessed livelihood diversity and performed a cluster analysis to develop a preliminary typology of U.S. permaculture farms. Farms were pre- dominantly small in scale, with a high proportion of young farmers, new farmers, and new farms, when compared with national figures. Diversity of farm-based income was high for enterprises and across seasons. Cluster analysis based on sources of income produced a preliminary typology with five categories: small mixed annual and perennial cropping (N = 10), integrated production (perennial and animal crops, N = 5), a mix of production and services (N = 9), animal base (N = 5), and service base (cultural services and material products and services, N = 5). Our research suggests that perma- culture farms fit well within the emerging framework of DFS, and are using a familiar set of strategies, including non-production enterprises, in order to develop and maintain diversified agroecosystems.},

  abstract = {The article discusses the issues related to personal knowledge management (PKM) and initiatives undertaken in this area by a professional group of teachers. These issues are still insufficiently researched, and thus cognitively interesting and requiring further exploration. The aim of the study was to determine the level of teachers' initiative in the area of personal knowledge management, with reference to the relationships between the variables characterizing the surveyed teachers, such as: gender, age, seniority, type of educational institution and the position held. In the study, conducted by means of a diagnostic survey method among 169 professionally active teachers, the author's Questionnaire of Personal Knowledge Management Initiatives was used. The obtained research results were statistically analyzed using the PSPP program, Gnu General Public License Version 3. The data were processed using the ANOVA analysis of variance. The applied method of standard deviations showed that the largest group of the surveyed teachers presents an average level of initiative in the field of personal knowledge management. Based on the obtained results, it can also be concluded that: women, teachers with the longest seniority, from the oldest age group, holding managerial positions; employed in kindergartens and educational non-school institutions, are characterized by a higher level of initiative in the field of personal knowledge management. The obtained research results are of practical importance both for teachers and for the organizations in which they work. They may also contribute to the introduction of new solutions in the education of future teachers at the university level, as well as to the organization of training and workshops improving and developing personal knowledge management skills among professionally active teachers.},

  abstract = {To leverage the fullest potential of systemic design research in real-world contexts, more diverse and reflexive approaches are necessary. Especially for addressing the place-based and unpredictable nature of sustainability transformations, scholars across disciplines caution that standard research strategies and methods often fall short. While systemic design promotes concepts such as holism, plurality, and emergence, more insight is necessary for translating these ideas into practices for engaging in complex, real-world applications. Reflexivity is crucial to understanding these implications, and systemic design practice will benefit from a deeper discourse on the relationships between researchers, contexts, and methods. In this study, we offer an illustrated example of applying a diverse and reflexive systems oriented design approach that engaged three mountain communities undergoing sustainability transformations. Based on a longitudinal, comparative research project, a combination of methods from systemic design, social science, education, and embodied practices was developed and prototyped across three mountain regions: Ostana, Italy; Hemsedal, Norway; and Mammoth Lakes, California. The selection of these regions was influenced by the researchers' varying levels of previous engagement. Reflexivity was used to explore how place-based relationships influenced the researchers' interactions with each community. Different modes of reflexivity were used to analyze the contextual, relational, and boundary-related factors that shaped how the framing, format, and communication of each method and practice adapted over time. We discuss these findings through visualizations and narrative examples to translate abstract concepts like emergence and plurality into actionable insights. This study contributes to systemic design research by showing how a reflexive approach of weaving across different places, methods, and worldviews supports the critical facilitation processes needed to apply and advance methodological plurality in practice.},

  abstract = {Qualitative modeling concerns the representations and reasoning that people use to understand continuous aspects of the world. Qualitative models formalize everyday notions of causality and provide accounts of how to ground symbolic, relational representations in perceptual processes. This article surveys the basic ideas of qualitative modeling and their applications from a cognitive science perspective. It describes the basic principles of qualitative modeling, and a variety of qualitative representations that have been developed for quantities and for relationships between them, providing a kind of qualitative mathematics. Three ontological frameworks for organizing modeling knowledge (processes, components, and field) are summarized, along with research on automatically assembling models for particular tasks from such knowledge. Qualitative simulation and how it carves up time into meaningful units is discussed. We discuss several accounts of causal reasoning about dynamical systems, based on different choices of qualitative mathematics and ontology. Qualitative spatial reasoning is explored, both in terms of relational systems and visual reasoning. Applications of qualitative models of particular interest to cognitive scientists are described, including how they have been used to capture the expertise of scientists and engineers and how they have been used in education. Open questions and frontiers are also discussed, focusing on relationships between ideas developed in the qualitative modeling community and other areas of cognitive science.

  abstract = {Graph vertices are often organized into groups that seem to live fairly independently of the rest of the graph, with which they share but a few edges, whereas the relationships between group members are stronger, as shown by the large number of mutual connections. Such groups of vertices, or communities, can be considered as independent compartments of a graph. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. The task is very hard, though, both conceptually, due to the ambiguity in the definition of community and in the discrimination of different partitions and practically, because algorithms must find ``good'' partitions among an exponentially large number of them. Other complications are represented by the possible occurrence of hierarchies, i.e. communities which are nested inside larger communities, and by the existence of overlaps between communities, due to the presence of nodes belonging to more groups. All these aspects are dealt with in some detail and many methods are described, from traditional approaches used in computer science and sociology to recent techniques developed mostly within statistical physics.},

We review research-backed guidelines for creating effective and intuitive visualizations oriented toward communicating data to students, coworkers, and the general public. We describe how the visual system can quickly extract broad statistics from a display, whereas poorly designed displays can lead to misperceptions and illusions. Extracting global statistics is fast, but comparing between subsets of values is slow. Effective graphics avoid taxing working memory, guide attention, and respect familiar conventions. Data visualizations can play a critical role in teaching and communication, provided that designers tailor those visualizations to their audience.},

I begin by exploring the literature on CSR and development in the mining industry, motives for CSR engagement in the industry, and risk and risk management. I then draw on my research data to map how CSR programmes are seen as an important method of managing strategic challenges to firms --- categorised here as reputational, operational or regulatory `risks'---and note how competition for capital and recent changes in the legal environment have furthered this process. A focus on CSR as risk management can illuminate the poor development outcomes of community CSR projects, despite recent rises in spending. `CSR as risk management' introduces immanent limitations including treating CSR as PR, targeting those that pose the greatest threat rather than those with the greatest need, excessively simplifying complex processes and focussing on maintaining the status quo. In risk management thinking, CSR activities may be a high organisational priority, integrated into central decision-making processes and subject to a great deal of investment, but still see little progress towards inclusive development for those living closest to mining operations. I conclude by reflecting on what this means for future action and research.},

The paper also identifies the dated and unsatisfactory philosophical positions of operationalism and inductivism as the philosophical backdrop to the hierarchy. The paper concludes with a sketch of some positive theories, of value to information science, on the nature of the components of the hierarchy: that data is anything recordable in a semantically and pragmatically sound way, that information is what is known in other literature as `weak knowledge', that knowledge also is `weak knowledge' and that wisdom is the possession and use, if required, of wide practical knowledge, by an agent who appreciates the fallible nature of that knowledge.},

A model by sociologist Roy Wallis with different possibilities for the charismatic leader to respond to institutionalization will be applied, and a previous application by sociologist Susan J. Palmer will be discussed. I argue that Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, later known as Osho, was more active in the institutionalization of the movement than is depicted by the group, and that legal reasons may have been the motivation for both his vow of silence from 1981 to 1984 and the creation of the religion Rajneeshism in 1983.},

  abstract = {The medial entorhinal cortex is part of a neural system for mapping the position of an individual within a physical environment1. Grid cells, a key component of this system, fire in a characteristic hexagonal pattern of locations2, and are organized in modules3 that collectively form a population code for the animal's allocentric position1. The invariance of the correlation structure of this population code across environments4,5 and behavioural states6,7, independent of specific sensory inputs, has pointed to intrinsic, recurrently connected continuous attractor networks (CANs) as a possible substrate of the grid pattern1,8--11. However, whether grid cell networks show continuous attractor dynamics, and how they interface with inputs from the environment, has remained unclear owing to the small samples of cells obtained so far. Here, using simultaneous recordings from many hundreds of grid cells and subsequent topological data analysis, we show that the joint activity of grid cells from an individual module resides on a toroidal manifold, as expected in a two-dimensional CAN. Positions on the torus correspond to positions of the moving animal in the environment. Individual cells are preferentially active at singular positions on the torus. Their positions are maintained between environments and from wakefulness to sleep, as predicted by CAN models for grid cells but not by alternative feedforward models12. This demonstration of network dynamics on a toroidal manifold provides a population-level visualization of CAN dynamics in grid cells.},

  abstract = {One of the most troubling trends in criminal investigations is the growing use of ``black box'' technology, in which law enforcement rely on artificial intelligence (AI) models or algorithms that are either too complex for people to understand or they simply conceal how it functions. In criminal cases, black box systems have proliferated in forensic areas such as DNA mixture interpretation, facial recognition, and recidivism risk assessments. The champions and critics of AI argue, mistakenly, that we face a catch 22: While black box AI is not understandable by people, they assume that it produces more accurate forensic evidence. In this Article, we question this assertion, which has so powerfully affected judges, policymakers, and academics. We describe a mature body of computer science research showing how ``glass box'' AI---designed to be interpretable---can be more accurate than black box alternatives. Indeed, black box AI performs predictably worse in settings like the criminal system. Debunking the black box performance myth has implications for forensic evidence, constitutional criminal procedure rights, and legislative policy. Absent some compelling---or even credible---government interest in keeping AI as a black box, and given the constitutional rights and public safety interests at stake, we argue that a substantial burden rests on the government to justify black box AI in criminal cases. We conclude by calling for judicial rulings and legislation to safeguard a right to interpretable forensic AI.},

The Digging into Data 3 challenge (DID3) (2014--2016) is an international, interdisciplinary and collaborative grant initiative, and the purpose of this paper is to explore skills that faculty and students brought to projects and others they acquired and shared on collaborative teams. Rooted in the naturalistic paradigm, this qualitative case study centers on semi-structured interviews with 53 participants on 11 of the 14 DID3 projects. Documentary evidence complements empirical evidence; analysis is constructivist and grounded. Hailing from diverse academic research institutions, centers and repositories, participants brought 20 types of discipline-based or interdisciplinary expertise to DID3 projects. But they reported acquiring or refining 27 other skills during their project work. While most are data-related, complementary programming, management and analytical skills push disciplinary expertise toward new frontiers. Project-based learning and pedagogy function symbiotically; participants therefore advocate for aligning problem-solving skills with pedagogical objectives at home institutions to prepare for public-funded DH projects. A modified content analysis juxtaposes DID3 skills with those advanced in 23 recent DH syllabi to identify commonalities and gaps. Pedagogy has an important yet under-researched and underdeveloped role in public-funded DH research.},

  abstract = {In response to a growing interest in refining brain connectivity assessments, this study focuses on integrating white matter fiber-specific microstructural properties into structural connectomes. Spanning ages 8--19 years in a developmental sample, it explores age-related patterns of microstructure-informed network properties at both local and global scales. First, the diffusion-weighted signal fraction associated with each tractography-reconstructed streamline was constructed. Subsequently, the convex optimization modeling for microstructure-informed tractography (COMMIT) approach was employed to generate microstructure-informed connectomes from diffusion MRI data. To complete the investigation, network characteristics within eight functionally defined networks (visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention, ventral attention, limbic, fronto-parietal, default mode, and subcortical networks) were evaluated. The findings underscore a consistent increase in global efficiency across child and adolescent development within the visual, somatomotor, and default mode networks (p \&lt; 0.005). Additionally, mean strength exhibits an upward trend in the somatomotor and visual networks (p \&lt; 0.001). Notably, nodes within the dorsal and ventral visual pathways manifest substantial age-dependent changes in local efficiency, aligning with existing evidence of extended maturation in these pathways. The outcomes strongly support the notion of a prolonged developmental trajectory for visual association cortices. This study contributes valuable insights into the nuanced dynamics of microstructure-informed brain connectivity throughout different developmental stages.There is a growing interest in incorporating biologically relevant white matter properties into the analysis of brain networks to obtain a more quantitative assessment of brain connectivity. In a developmental sample aged 8--19 years, we studied age-related patterns of local and global network properties. We generated microstructure-informed connectomes using diffusion MRI data, and computed network characteristics in eight functionally defined networks (visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention, ventral attention, limbic, fronto-parietal, default mode, and subcortical networks). The findings reveal that throughout child and adolescent development, global efficiency increases in the visual, somatomotor, and default mode networks, and mean strength increases in the somatomotor and visual networks. Nodes belonging to the dorsal and ventral visual pathways demonstrate the largest age-dependence in local efficiency, supporting previous evidence of protracted maturation of dorsal and ventral visual pathways. The results provide compelling evidence that there is a prolonged development of visual association cortices.},

  abstract = {The transportation sector contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, so it is crucial to assess and measure the sustainability of transportation systems. In this context, this study was conducted to develop an integrated index through the use of the multi-criteria decision analysis method. The method combines existing discrete indexes into one comprehensive evaluation of public transportation, resulting in the sustainable transport planning index (STPI). In the STPI model, sustainability of transportation systems is assessed based on social, economic, and environmental factors that support the implementation of zero emission busses. The weight of each indicator is determined through the analytical hierarchy process, where expert judgment is used to assess the relative importance of each indicator. Normalization of indicators is performed to ensure comparability and consistency. The final STPI index is calculated as the weighted average of the normalized indicators. The STPI model reduces bias in the decision-making process by considering multiple aspects and utilizing a structured approach to transport planning. The results of this method can provide valuable insights for decision-makers, public transport agencies, government ministries, the private sector, and other stakeholders. As case study model, the STPI model was applied to the public transport system of the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2019, however; the methodology and lessons learned are applicable to all countries that are in the process of assembling data sets to weigh trade-offs and inclusions in relation to sustainable transit such as accessibility and health impacts.},

We are all receptors of the "quality of physics" from an energetic perspective - we see electromagnetic radiation in the range of 400 to 700 nanometers and call this color; we hear compression of air waves and call this sound, we feel with our skin via sensors that transmit signals to our brain; the same can be said of all of our primary senses. Sound and color and all energies are related through resonance. Dr. Karim discovered that higher harmonics of 3 energy qualities, that he called BG3, were beneficial to health of humans, animals and plants.~ He discovered ways to create these energies and studied the beneficial effects of the energies on diseases such as hepatitis C, on reversing EMF sensitivity, growing plants without pesticides, raising chickens without use of antibiotics, and lowering leucocytes in cows milk.~ This article describes the principles of BioGeometry and gives examples of the studies that have been conducted which demonstrate the utility of BioGeometry.},

  abstract = {The language of graph theory, or network science, has proven to be an exceptional tool for addressing myriad problems in neuroscience. Yet, the use of networks is predicated on a critical simplifying assumption: that the quintessential unit of interest in a brain is a dyad -- two nodes (neurons or brain regions) connected by an edge. While rarely mentioned, this fundamental assumption inherently limits the types of neural structure and function that graphs can be used to model. Here, we describe a generalization of graphs that overcomes these limitations, thereby offering a broad range of new possibilities in terms of modeling and measuring neural phenomena. Specifically, we explore the use of {\textbackslash}emph\{simplicial complexes\}, a theoretical notion developed in the field of mathematics known as algebraic topology, which is now becoming applicable to real data due to a rapidly growing computational toolset. We review the underlying mathematical formalism as well as the budding literature applying simplicial complexes to neural data, from electrophysiological recordings in animal models to hemodynamic fluctuations in humans. Based on the exceptional flexibility of the tools and recent ground-breaking insights into neural function, we posit that this framework has the potential to eclipse graph theory in unraveling the fundamental mysteries of cognition.},

  abstract = {Theorists have argued that the ``attempt to comprehend'' the genocidal event represented by Auschwitz has ``defeated the intellects of countless men and women''. Memorials at Auschwitz and other concentration camps such as Dachau and Buchenwald, and to a certain extent those outside of Europe, such as Tuol Sleng and Choeung Ek in Cambodia, are attempts to call attention to these atrocities in the hope of preventing the repetition of their like. Yet these projects, like all historical monuments and memorials, face the problem of a certain coldness and indifference caused by historical distance, consumerist culture and the seemingly abstract nature of historical images and documents. Concentration camp memorials are not entirely immune from these problems. However, in their use of an embodied semiotics invoking the visitor's own body as a direct participant in immersive environments, sensory surfaces and displays, these memorials engage -- not unproblematically -- in a project to realize this history in visceral and concrete ways. This paper examines the semiotic strategies of the concentration camp as a technique of ``embodying'' suffering that is intended to counter the dissipation of affect in a media-saturated consumerist era.},

With a particular focus on the digital worlds of cultural heritage collections, the book also includes chapters that focus on machine learning, knowledge graphs, text analysis, text annotations and network analysis. Other topics covered include: semantic technologies, conceptual schemas and data augmentation, digital scholarly editing, metadata creation, browsing, visualisation and relevance ranking. Most importantly, perhaps, the book provides a starting point for discussions about the impact of information and knowledge organisation and related tools on the methodologies used in the Digital Humanities field. Information and Knowledge Organisation is intended for use by researchers, students and professionals interested in the role information and knowledge organisation plays in the Digital Humanities. It will be essential reading for those working in library and information science, computer science and across the humanities.},

The research considers a brief analysis of big pharma through real-world examples, but also takes on an autoethnographic approach as an individual who is an active consumer of big pharma. Utilizing my own account and voice as an individual with a genetic progressive chronic illness and disability called Cystic Fibrosis becomes integral to the research and the prototype creation process. Feminist queer Crip, which is a sub section of crip Theory, and disability aesthetics, further enrich the research as the theoretical background when analyzing how the long-standing thought process of compulsive non-disabled bodiedness is harmful and can further lead to devaluing disabled and chronically ill bodies in the medical system, and thus creates access friction or lack of access to care. The results of the research and prototype creation seeks to educate on how access friction can be harmful to disabled and chronically ill bodies, which leads us to utilize speculative futures to dream about what easy access to care might look like and helps us understand why access to care is vital when we consider disabled and chronically ill bodies as valuable within the medical system.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives: The expansion of evidence-based practice across sectors has lead to an increasing variety of review types. However, the diversity of terminology used means that the full potential of these review types may be lost amongst a confusion of indistinct and misapplied terms. The objective of this study is to provide descriptive insight into the most common types of reviews, with illustrative examples from health and health information domains. Methods: Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework---Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA)---was used to examine the main review types. Results: Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A description of the key characteristics is given, together with perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review types are currently utilized within the health information domain. Conclusions: Few review types possess prescribed and explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually exclusive. Notwithstanding such limitations, this typology provides a valuable reference point for those commissioning, conducting, supporting or interpreting reviews, both within health information and the wider health care domain.},

We take an engineering perspective on the development of such ontologies. Formal ontologies are viewed as designed artifacts, formulated for specific purposes and evaluated against objective design criteria. We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering mathematics and bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are discussed, and alternative representation choices and evaluated against the design criteria.},

  abstract = {Creating institutions to meet the challenge of sustainability is arguably the most important task confronting society; it is also dauntingly complex. Ecological, economic, and social elements all play a role, but despite ongoing efforts, researchers have yet to succeed in integrating the various disciplines in a way that gives adequate representation to the insights of each.Panarchy, a term devised to describe evolving hierarchical systems with multiple interrelated elements, offers an important new framework for understanding and resolving this dilemma. Panarchy is the structure in which systems, including those of nature (e.g., forests) and of humans (e.g., capitalism), as well as combined human-natural systems (e.g., institutions that govern natural resource use such as the Forest Service), are interlinked in continual adaptive cycles of growth, accumulation, restructuring, and renewal. These transformational cycles take place at scales ranging from a drop of water to the biosphere, over periods from days to geologic epochs. By understanding these cycles and their scales, researchers can identify the points at which a system is capable of accepting positive change, and can use those leverage points to foster resilience and sustainability within the system.This volume brings together leading thinkers on the subject -- including Fikret Berkes, Buz Brock, Steve Carpenter, Carl Folke, Lance Gunderson, C.S. Holling, Don Ludwig, Karl-Goran Maler, Charles Perrings, Marten Scheffer, Brian Walker, and Frances Westley -- to develop and examine the concept of panarchy and to consider how it can be applied to human, natural, and human-natural systems. Throughout, contributors seek to identify adaptive approaches to management that recognize uncertainty and encourage innovation while fostering resilience.The book is a fundamental new development in a widely acclaimed line of inquiry. It represents the first step in integrating disciplinary knowledge for the adaptive management of human-natural systems across widely divergent scales, and offers an important base of knowledge from which institutions for adaptive management can be developed. It will be an invaluable source of ideas and understanding for students, researchers, and professionals involved with ecology, conservation biology, ecological economics, environmental policy, or related fields.}

  abstract = {Many research and industry organizations outsource labour-intensive processes of data generation, annotation, and algorithmic verification---what this dissertation refers to as data work---to workers worldwide through digital platforms. A subset of the gig economy, these platforms consider workers independent users with no employment rights, pay them per task, and control them with automated algorithmic managers. This dissertation focuses its study on the data worker population in Venezuela---a Latin American country experiencing a socioeconomic crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and where a significant number of data workers in the Global South are located---to understand the coloniality of data work, or the historical patterns of power that define contemporary data production. This dissertation looks at how power imbalances are reproduced in outsourced data work through a configuration of actions, discourses, and objects---the ``data production dispositif''---by which platform companies profit from marginalized workers in a socioeconomic condition characterized by high disembeddedness, or a lack of regulations and protections on the population. Social inequalities are reproduced through the data production process and local worker communities mitigate these power imbalances by relying on the support of family members, neighbours, and colleagues online. Furthermore, the data production dispositif ensures that workers' voices are suppressed in the data annotation process through algorithmic management and surveillance, resulting in datasets generated exclusively by clients, with their worldviews encoded in algorithms through training. The coloniality of data work is thus characterized by an extractivist method of generating data that privileges profit and the epistemic dominance of those in power. This dissertation argues that data production is a process and that the quality of data and artificial intelligence algorithms depend on incorporating a plurality of workers' voices and the decommodification of their labour away from market dependency. This process is multifaceted and requires the responsibility of the computing industry, policy centred on worker communities, and support of local worker-led initiatives.},

  abstract = {Background             Internationally, the impact of continued exposure to workplace environmental and psychological stressors on health care professionals' mental health is associated with increased depression, substance misuse, sleep disorders, and posttraumatic stress. This can lead to staff burnout, poor quality health care, and reduced patient safety outcomes. Strategies to improve the psychological health and well-being of health care staff have been highlighted as a critical priority worldwide. The concept of resilience for health care professionals as a tool for negotiating workplace adversity has gained increasing prominence.                                   Objective             This systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of web-based interventions to enhance resilience in health care professionals.                                   Methods             We searched the PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Ovid SP databases for relevant records published after 1990 until July 2021. We included studies that focused on internet-delivered interventions aiming at enhancing resilience. Study quality was assessed with the Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomized controlled trial designs and Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for other study designs. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; CRD42021253190). PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed.                                   Results             A total of 8 studies, conducted between 2014 and 2020 and involving 1573 health care workers, were included in the review. In total, 4 randomized controlled trial designs and 4 pre- and postdesign studies were conducted across a range of international settings and health care disciplines. All of these studies aimed to evaluate the impact of web-based interventions on resilience or related symptoms in health care professionals involved in patient-facing care. Interventions included various web-based formats and therapeutic approaches over variable time frames. One randomized controlled trial directly measured resilience, whereas the remaining 3 used proxy measures to measure psychological concepts linked to resilience. Three pretest and posttest studies directly measured resilience, whereas the fourth study used a proxy resilience measure. Owing to the heterogeneity of outcome measures and intervention designs, meta-analysis was not possible, and qualitative data synthesis was undertaken. All studies found that resilience or proxy resilience levels were enhanced in health care workers following the implementation of web-based interventions. The overall risk of bias of all 8 studies was low.                                   Conclusions             The findings indicate that web-based interventions designed to enhance resilience may be effective in clinical practice settings and have the potential to provide support to frontline staff experiencing prolonged workplace stress across a range of health care professional groups. However, the heterogeneity of included studies means that findings should be interpreted with caution; more web-based interventions need rigorous testing to further develop the evidence base.

  abstract = {Background: Electronic waste (e-waste) is produced in staggering quantities, estimated globally to be 41.8 million tonnes in 2014. Informal e-waste recycling is a source of much-needed income in many low- to middle-income countries. However, its handling and disposal in underdeveloped countries is often unsafe and leads to contaminated environments. Rudimentary and uncontrolled processing methods often result in substantial harmful chemical exposures among vulnerable populations, including women and children. E-waste hazards have not yet received the attention they deserve in research and public health agendas. Objectives: We provide an overview of the scale and health risks. We review international efforts concerned with environmental hazards, especially affecting children, as a preface to presenting next steps in addressing health issues stemming from the global e-waste problem. Discussion: The e-waste problem has been building for decades. Increased observation of adverse health effects from e-waste sites calls for protecting human health and the environment from e-waste contamination. Even if e-waste exposure intervention and prevention efforts are implemented, legacy contamination will remain, necessitating increased awareness of e-waste as a major environmental health threat. Conclusion: Global, national, and local levels efforts must aim to create safe recycling operations that consider broad security issues for people who rely on e-waste processing for survival. Paramount to these efforts is reducing pregnant women and children's e-waste exposures to mitigate harmful health effects. With human environmental health in mind, novel dismantling methods and remediation technologies and intervention practices are needed to protect communities.

Robyn Henderson-Espinoza shows readers how action and contemplation can be brought together for the sake of political liberation and social change. Featuring the poetry of Brittini 'Ree Belle' Gray, this rich and interdisciplinary work draws on continental philosophy, queer theology, and critical class theory in accessible and artful ways. It employs story, personal narratives, and cultural analysis to explain the methods, sources, and objectives of activist theology. Activist Theology is essential reading for all who want to see theology and ethics break new ground in working for justice, hope, and liberation for all." --},

Does wearing so much hardware ever get overwhelming? This thesis attempts to discover the relationships between virtuality, interaction and hardware encumberment, and offers a new comparative tool which can help designers make more informed decisions about the use of hardware in their experiences.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The last decade saw an enormous boost in the field of computational topology: methods and concepts from algebraic and differential topology, formerly confined to the realm of pure mathematics, have demonstrated their utility in numerous areas such as computational biology personalised medicine, and time-dependent data analysis, to name a few. The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as ``topological machine learning,'' i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

TDA has proven useful to disentangle non-trivial data structures in a broad range of data analytics problems including the study of cardiovascular signals. Here, we aim to provide an overview of the application of TDA to cardiovascular signals and its potential to enhance the understanding of cardiovascular diseases and their treatment in the form of a literature or narrative review. We first introduce the concept of TDA and its key techniques, including persistent homology, Mapper, and multidimensional scaling. We then discuss the use of TDA in analyzing various cardiovascular signals, including electrocardiography, photoplethysmography, and arterial stiffness. We also discuss the potential of TDA to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases, as well as its limitations and challenges. Finally, we outline future directions for the use of TDA in cardiovascular signal analysis and its potential impact on clinical practice. Overall, TDA shows great promise as a powerful tool for the analysis of complex cardiovascular signals and may offer significant insights into the understanding and management of cardiovascular diseases.},

However, nodelink diagrams comprised of a large number of nodes and edges often suffer from visual clutter. The use of edge bundling remedies this and reveals high-level edge patterns. Previous methods require the graph to contain a hierarchy for this, or they construct a control mesh to guide the edge bundling process, which often results in bundles that show considerable variation in curvature along the overall bundle direction. We present a new edge bundling method that uses a self-organizing approach to bundling in which edges are modeled as flexible springs that can attract each other. In contrast to previous methods, no hierarchy is used and no control mesh. The resulting bundled graphs show significant clutter reduction and clearly visible high-level edge patterns. Curvature variation is furthermore minimized, resulting in smooth bundles that are easy to follow. Finally, we present a rendering technique that can be used to emphasize the bundling.},

Ghana Health Services (GHS) together with the UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund) Country Office have developed a systematic process that effectively identifies, analyzes, and responds to COVID-19 and vaccine-related misinformation in Ghana.                                   Objective             This paper describes an infodemic management system workflow based on digital data collection, qualitative methodology, and human-centered systems to support the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in Ghana with examples of system implementation.                                   Methods             The infodemic management system was developed by the Health Promotion Division of the GHS and the UNICEF Country Office. It uses Talkwalker, a social listening software platform, to collect misinformation on the web. The methodology relies on qualitative data analysis and interpretation as well as knowledge cocreation to verify the findings.                                   Results             A multi-sectoral National Misinformation Task Force was established to implement and oversee the misinformation management system. Two members of the task force were responsible for carrying out the analysis. They used Talkwalker to find posts that include the keywords related to COVID-19 vaccine--related discussions. They then assessed the significance of the posts on the basis of the engagement rate and potential reach of the posts, negative sentiments, and contextual factors. The process continues by identifying misinformation within the posts, rating the risk of identified misinformation posts, and developing proposed responses to address them. The results of the analysis are shared weekly with the Misinformation Task Force for their review and verification to ensure that the risk assessment and responses are feasible, practical, and acceptable in the context of Ghana.

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users' typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

This volume is not an introductory manual for beginners, but they will get an impression of the value of semiotic analysis through a number of case studies. Yelle treats his topics in their ostensible specificity so as to trace more general and significant issues concerning signification, communication, ideology, and agency in the construction of social worlds. Semiotics is especially important for theorizing about religion in terms of social constructionism and discourse theory. Finally, a few notes on the available literature are offered.},

  abstract = {Natural languages are easy to learn by infants, they can express any thought that any adult might ever conceive, and they accommodate the limitations of human breathing rates and short-term memory. The first property implies a finite vocabulary, the second implies infinite extensibility, and the third implies a small upper bound on the length of phrases. Together, they imply that most words in a natural language will have an open-ended number of senses --- ambiguity is inevitable. Peirce and Wittgenstein are two philosophers who understood that vagueness and ambiguity are not defects in language, but essential properties that enable it to accommodate anything and everything that people need to say. In analyzing the ambiguities, Wittgenstein developed his theory of language games, which allow words to have different senses in different contexts, applications, or modes of use. Recent developments in lexical semantics, which are remarkably compatible with the views of Peirce and Wittgenstein, are based on the recognition that words have an open-ended number of dynamically changing and context-dependent microsenses. The resulting flexibility enables natural languages to adapt to any possible subject from any perspective for any humanly conceivable purpose. To achieve a comparable level of flexibility with formal ontologies, this paper proposes an organization with a dynamically evolving collection of formal theories, systematic mappings to and from formal concept types and informal lexicons of natural language terms, and a modularity that allows independent distributed development and extension of all resources, formal and informal.

Synthesis maps evolved from earlier visualization tools in systemics and design. They help stakeholders to understand design options for complex sociotechnical systems. Other visual approaches map complexity for effective collaboration across perspectives and knowledge domains. These help stakeholder groups to work in higher-order design contexts for sociotechnical or human-ecological systems. This article describes a constructivist pedagogy for collaborative learning in small teams of mixed-discipline designers. Synthesis mapping enables these teams to learn systems methods for design research in complex problem domains. Synthesis maps integrate knowledge from research cycles and iterative sensemaking to define a coherent design narrative. While synthesis maps may include formal system modeling techniques, they do not require them. Synthesis maps tangibly render research observations and design choices. As a hybrid system design method, synthesis maps are a contribution to the design genre of visual systems thinking.},

It examines the MII logo as a key visual signifier which enacts significant `reframing' strategies for Brand India as it builds upon its emerging market status and the wider Indian institutional context. The analysis demonstrates how this re-alignment of perceptions is performed at the micro level by the verbo-visual logo, which in turn is enacted through strategy at the meso level and reflects perceptual shifts required by the nation brand at the macro level. The study uses visual semiotic analysis, recalls Barthes' (in: Heath (ed) Image/music/text, Fontana, London, 1977[1964]) seminal work on text--image relations to introduce an extended application of the principles of `anchorage' and `relay', and draws upon `framing' as a useful construct to discuss the semiotic import of visual devices and their differentiated role in investment branding initiatives. It acknowledges the reciprocity of investment promotion and nation branding strategies and seeks to provide an explicatory framework to academics and marketing practitioners.},

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sampleefficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

  abstract = {How does scientific knowledge grow? This question has occupied a central place in the philosophy of science, stimulating heated debates but yielding no clear consensus. Many explanations can be understood in terms of whether and how they view the expansion of knowledge as proceeding through the accretion of scientific concepts into larger conceptual structures. Here we examine these views empirically by analysing 2,605,224 papers spanning five decades from both the social sciences (Web of Science) and the physical sciences (American Physical Society). Using natural language processing techniques, we create semantic networks of concepts, wherein noun phrases become linked when used in the same paper abstract. We then detect the core/periphery structures of these networks, wherein core concepts are densely connected sets of highly central nodes and periphery concepts are sparsely connected nodes that are highly connected to the core. For both the social and physical sciences, we observe increasingly rigid conceptual cores accompanied by the proliferation of periphery concepts. Subsequently, we examine the relationship between conceptual structure and the growth of scientific knowledge, finding that scientific works are more innovative in fields with cores that have higher conceptual churn and with larger cores. Furthermore, scientific consensus is associated with reduced conceptual churn and fewer conceptual cores. Overall, our findings suggest that while the organization of scientific concepts is important for the growth of knowledge, the mechanisms vary across time.},

  abstract = {The grand challenges of our time, such as Sustainability Transitions (ST) are non-linear, interdisciplinary and systemic. In such complex contexts, prescriptive or reductionist approaches are not sufficient in addressing the interconnected and emergent nature of societal transitions. This thesis argues the need for a systemic praxeology for designers engaged with ST, beyond the dominant attention given to method- and tool-development. This becomes critically important as designers and their designerly approaches are increasingly involved with systemic innovation. We now observe ambitious public-sector, and industry-wide innovation initiatives at the systems level, in which designers frequently take the role of facilitators and intermediaries. As such, systemic design practitioners must orient themselves in the vast landscape of transdisciplinary knowledge, while acknowledging the normative of transitions towards a long-term sustainable and just future.},

But humans are not machines. When we are ill, we experience our illness: we become scared, distressed, tired, weary. Our illnesses are not just biological conditions, but human ones. It was Arthur Kleinman, a Harvard psychiatrist and anthropologist, who saw this truth when most of his fellow doctors did not. Based on decades of clinical experience studying and treating chronic illness, The Illness Narratives makes a case for interpreting the illness experience of patients as a core feature of doctoring.Before Being Mortal, there was The Illness Narratives. It remains today a prescient and passionate case for bridging the gap between patient and practitioner.},

  abstract = {This thesis makes the case for ekphrasis -- the description of the visual in language -- as a three-part model for movement: from origin, accumulation, to release.     The written portion consists of three ekphrastic essays to/about art objects --- paintings of mothers, photographs of trans friends as children, and sculptures of unmade beds --- sentimental objects, theoretical sources, and dear friends. Each chapter corresponds to each of ekphrasis' three movements, culminating collectively to ekphrastic release. The first chapter establishes ekphrasis' psychoanalytic origin: as ekphrasis repeats the grief of the first loss through mimesis' recall, the memory changes, transforming into a kind of forgiveness. The second chapter builds a theory of trans materiality, in which the orientation/phenomenological ``purposefulness'' toward a word-object moves the self toward the self, and the word-objects accumulate as one's life becomes one's life. The third chapter uses the ekphrasis of accessible text/image description as a scale model for interpersonal world building, an ekphrasis which does, which tangibly imagines different intimacies and futures in our co-constructed common grounds.    The project also includes a commissioned performance by the poets Sanna Wani and Elizabeth Mudenyo at Xpace Cultural Centre on March 16, 2024.

In this survey we consider several classical algorithms, starting from Tutte's 1963 barycentric method, and including recent scalable multiscale methods for large and dynamic graphs.},

Community structure is one of the features that are recognized and reproduced by embeddings. We show that an iterative procedure, in which a graph is repeatedly embedded and its links are reweighted based on the geometric proximity between the nodes, reinforces intra-community links and weakens inter-community links, making the clusters of the initial network more visible and more easily detectable. The geometric separation between the communities can become so strong that even a very simple parsing of the links may recover the communities as isolated components with surprisingly high precision. Furthermore, when used as a pre-processing step, our embedding and reweighting procedure can improve the performance of traditional community detection algorithms.},

In Paper Machines, Markus Krajewski traces the evolution of this proto-computer of rearrangeable parts (file cards) that became ubiquitous in offices between the world wars. The story begins with Konrad Gessner, a sixteenth-century Swiss polymath who described a new method of processing data: to cut up a sheet of handwritten notes into slips of paper, with one fact or topic per slip, and arrange as desired. In the late eighteenth century, the card catalog became the librarian's answer to the threat of information overload. Then, at the turn of the twentieth century, business adopted the technology of the card catalog as a bookkeeping tool. Krajewski explores this conceptual development and casts the card file as a "universal paper machine" that accomplishes the basic operations of Turing's universal discrete machine: storing, processing, and transferring data. In telling his story, Krajewski takes the reader on a number of illuminating detours, telling us, for example, that the card catalog and the numbered street address emerged at the same time in the same city (Vienna), and that Harvard University's home-grown cataloging system grew out of a librarian's laziness; and that Melvil Dewey (originator of the Dewey Decimal System) helped bring about the technology transfer of card files to business." --Publisher's website},

A broad theoretical discussion about the semiotic characteristics of branding and antibranding is provided and ``digital antibranding semiotics'' is defined. The semiotics of consumer digital antibranding efforts are investigated in two studies examining a sample of antibranding images targeted at valuable corporate brands. The first study reveals that antibranders use drama and humor to demonize, criminalize, dehumanize, and ``Hitlerize'' the targeted brands, creating strong antibrand voices and positioning themselves against corporate greed and wrongdoing. The second study found that consumers successfully decode antibranding semiotic representations and classify them in terms of message clarity, fact finding, and ``hostility versus entertainment values.'' These findings reveal that both antibranding images with dark humor and clear messages and an aggressive and intriguing message have the potential to influence consumers.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a theoretical and conceptual framework explaining how the United States is reinventing colonialism in the Global South through the domination of digital technology. Drawing on South Africa as a case example, it argues that US multinationals exercise imperial control at the architecture level of the digital ecosystem: software, hardware, and network connectivity. This gives rise to five related forms of domination. First, the monopoly power of multinational corporations is used for resource extraction through rent and surveillance, constituting a new form of economic domination. Second, by controlling the digital ecosystem, Big Tech corporations control computer-mediated experiences, giving them direct power over political, economic, and cultural domains of life -- a new form of imperial control. Third, the centerpiece of surveillance capitalism, Big Data, violates the sanctity of privacy and concentrates economic power into the hands of US corporations -- a system of global surveillance capitalism. Fourth, as a feature of surveillance capitalism, Global North intelligence agencies partner with their own corporations to conduct mass and targeted surveillance in the Global South. This intensifies imperial state surveillance. And fifth, US elites have persuaded most people that society must proceed according to its own ruling class conceptions of the digital world, setting the foundation for tech hegemony. These five features demonstrate that digital colonialism is both structural and conceptual, and the international community needs to create a fundamentally different tech ecosystem that decentralizes technological by placing control directly into the hands of the people. For this task, People's Technology for People's Power -- combined with education, grassroots movements, and creative legislation -- provides practical solutions to counter the rapidly advancing frontier of digital empire.},

  abstract = {The threshold concepts approach to student learning and curriculum design now informs an empirical research base comprising over 170 disciplinary and professional contexts. It draws extensively on the notion of troublesomeness in a 'liminal' space of learning. The latter is a transformative state in the process of learning in which there is a reformulation of the learner's meaning frame and an accompanying shift in the learner's ontology or subjectivity. Within the extensive literature on threshold concepts, however, the notion of liminal space has remained relatively ill-defined. This paper explores this spatial metaphor to help clarify the difficulties that some teachers observe in the classroom in regard to their students' understanding. It employs a novel and distinctive approach drawn from semiotic theory to to provide some explanatory insight into learning within the liminal space and render it more open to analysis. The paper develops its argument through four distinct phases. Firstly it explores the spatial metaphor of liminality to gain further purchase on the nature of this transformative space. The second section introduces semiotic theory and indicates how this will be used through a series of graphical and visual devices to render the liminal space more open to analysis. The third section then employs semiotic analysis to nine dimensions of pedagogical content knowledge to gain further insight into what may characterise student conceptual difficulty within the liminal state. The fourth and concluding section emphasises the role of context in conceptual discrimination before advocating a transactional curriculum inquiry approach to future research in this field.},

Problem Structuring Methods are described in the literature as facilitating transparent and participative ways of formulating and systemically modelling problems with a view to participants' co-defining alternative futures. We reflect upon the contribution of SDD as lying in its appreciation of ``third phase science'' and discuss links to other deliberative processes. We indicate why SDD can be classed as ``problem structuring'' despite the near absence of publicisation in the Operational Research (OR) literature to date. We discuss distinct contributions that the SDD offers to the OR world and indicate how it strengthens and extends Community OR, contributes to Critical Systems Thinking in OR, and offers new mathematical approaches that the Community OR practitioners may wish to consider using. By way of illustration, we showcase the ``European Initiative'' as an aspect of a large-scale project across five geographical regions funded by the United Nations Democracy Fund, in conjunction with the Future Worlds centre (2016--2018). It engaged as stakeholders five cohorts of youth pioneers concerned with formulating options for Re-inventing democracy in the digital age.},

  abstract = {"The emergence of modern sciences in the seventeenth century profoundly renewed our understanding of Nature. For the last three centuries new ideas of Nature have been continuously developed by theology, politics, economics, and science, especially the sciences of the material world. The situation is even more unstable today, now that we have entered an ecological mutation of unprecedented scale. Some call it the Anthropocene, but it is best described as a new climatic regime. And a new regime it certainly is, since the many unexpected connections between human activity and the natural world oblige every one of us to reopen the earlier notions of Nature and redistribute what had been packed inside. So the question now arises: what will replace the old ways of looking at Nature? This book explores a potential candidate proposed by James Lovelock when he chose the name "Gaia" for the fragile, complex system through which living phenomena modify the Earth. The fact that he was immediately misunderstood proves simply that his readers have tried to fit this new notion into an older frame, transforming Gaia into a single organism, a kind of giant thermostat, some sort of New Age goddess, or even divine Providence. In this series of lectures on "natural religion", Bruno Latour argues that the complex and ambiguous figure of Gaia offers, on the contrary, an ideal way to disentangle the ethical, political, theological, and scientific aspects of the now obsolete notion of Nature. He lays the groundwork for a future collaboration among scientists, theologians, activists, and artists as they, and we, begin to adjust to the new climatic regime"--},

  abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

  abstract = {By extending Cyc's ontology and KB approximately 2\%, Cycorp and Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) have built a system to answer clinical researchers' ad hoc queries. The query may be long and complex, hence only partially understood at first, parsed into a set of CycL (higher-order logic) fragments with open variables. But, surprisingly often, after applying various constraints (medical domain knowledge, common sense, discourse pragmatics, syntax), there is only one single way to fit those fragments together, one semantically meaningful formal query P. The system, SRA (for Semantic Research Assistant), dispatches a series of database calls and then combines, logically and arithmetically, their results into answers to P. Seeing the first few answers stream back, the user may realize that they need to abort, modify, and re-ask their query. Even before they push ASK, just knowing approximately how many answers would be returned can spark such editing. Besides real-time ad hoc query-answering, queries can be bundled and persist over time. One bundle of 275 queries is rerun quarterly by CCF to produce the procedures and outcomes data it needs to report to STS (Society of Thoracic Surgeons, an external hospital accreditation and ranking body); another bundle covers ACC (American College of Cardiology) reporting. Until full articulation/answering of precise, analytical queries becomes as straight-forward and ubiquitous as text search, even partial understanding of a query empowers semantic search over semi-structured data (ontology-tagged text), avoiding many of the false positives and false negatives that standard text searching suffers from.},

This gives it immense adaptive and constructive significance as noted by Dewey and other pragmatists. It enables us, for. instance, to design bridges with a sufficient factor of safety instead of building them haphazard and waiting to see whether they collapse, and to predict consequences of recondite physical or chemical processes whose value may often be more theoretical than practical. In all these cases the process of thought, reduced to its simplest terms, is as follows: a man observes some external event or process and arrives at some 'conclusion' or 'prediction' expressed in words or numbers that 'mean' or refer to or describe some external event or process which comes to pass if the man's reasoning was correct. During the process of reasoning, he may also have availed himself of words or numbers. Here there are three essential processes:}

However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode network structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. These network representation learning (NRL) approaches remove the need for painstaking feature engineering and have led to state-of-the-art results in network-based tasks, such as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. In this tutorial, we will cover key advancements in NRL over the last decade, with an emphasis on fundamental advancements made in the last two years. We will discuss classic matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms (e.g., DeepWalk and node2vec), as well as very recent advancements in graph neural networks. We will cover methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs, and in doing so, we will present a unified framework for NRL.},

Drawing from a larger ethnographic study, in this chapter the author illustrates how carrying out the transcription and analysis process within a CAQDAS package (in this case, Transana and ATLAS.ti) allows for an increase in transparency within the transcription and data analysis process, while also meeting the particular needs of the discourse analyst. By using one particular case/research study, the author demonstrates how CAQDAS packages might function to support a researcher in generating a more systematic and transparent analytical process, specifically during the early stages of the analysis process. The author gives particular attention to interactional data (i.e., 300 hours of video and audio recordings of therapy sessions) collected in a larger study and demonstrates the potential benefits of working across two CAQDAS packages, specifically Transana and ATLAS.ti, to support both the nuanced transcription process and the larger data analysis process.},

We find that another embedding method, NCE, is implicitly factorizing a similar matrix, where each cell is the (shifted) log conditional probability of a word given its context. We show that using a sparse Shifted Positive PMI word-context matrix to represent words improves results on two word similarity tasks and one of two analogy tasks. When dense low-dimensional vectors are preferred, exact factorization with SVD can achieve solutions that are at least as good as SGNS's solutions for word similarity tasks. On analogy questions SGNS remains superior to SVD. We conjecture that this stems from the weighted nature of SGNS's factorization.},

  abstract = {Word representation or word embedding is an important step in understanding languages. It maps similar words to vectors that are close in space. In this thesis, we introduce a deep neural network model called the Character-Morphology-Word network (CMW) for word representation. We implemented our CMW model and trained it on the Wikipedia corpus. We compared our model against two past approaches in a number of word-embedding tasks and found that, while the average performance of our model is not as good as the past approaches, our model achieves comparable precision and, in one task, our model outperforms these approaches. We also used our model to generate random text and found that our model produces words in the vocabulary and can produce lexical-correct text. The results of our research indicate that a deeper neural network can be used to represent words and ultimately, help solve related Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.},

However, with the quickly advancing field of NLP comes increased greenhouse gas emissions, posing concerns over the environmental damage caused by training LLMs. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the various costs, particularly those pertaining to environmental aspects, that are associated with artificial intelligence serves as the foundational basis for ensuring safe AI models. Currently, investigations into the CO2 emissions of AI models remain an emerging area of research, and as such, in this paper, we evaluate the CO2 emissions of well-known large language models, which have an especially high carbon footprint due to their significant amount of model parameters. We argue for the training of LLMs in a way that is responsible and sustainable by suggesting measures for reducing carbon emissions. Furthermore, we discuss how the choice of hardware affects CO2 emissions by contrasting the CO2 emissions during model training for two widely used GPUs. Based on our results, we present the benefits and drawbacks of our proposed solutions and make the argument for the possibility of training more environmentally safe AI models without sacrificing their robustness and performance.},

  abstract = {The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola (Latin original: Exercitia spiritualia), composed 1522--1524, are a set of Christian meditations, contemplations, and prayers written by Ignatius of Loyola, a 16th-century Spanish priest, theologian, and founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). Divided into four thematic "weeks" of variable length, they are designed to be carried out over a period of 28 to 30 days. They were composed with the intention of helping participants in religious retreats to discern the will of God in their lives, leading to a personal commitment to follow Jesus whatever the cost. Their underlying theology has been found agreeable to other Christian denominations who make use of them and also for addressing problems facing society in the 21st century. EditionsA review of the publication history of the Spiritual Exercises may be found on the website of Loyola Press. The first printed edition of the Spiritual Exercises was published in Latin in 1548, after being given papal approval by Pope Paul III. However, Ignatius's manuscripts were in Spanish, so this first edition was in fact a translation, although it was made during Ignatius's lifetime and with his approval. Many subsequent editions in Latin and in various other languages were printed early on with widely differing texts. Archival work on the authentic text of the Spiritual Exercises was undertaken at the initiative of the 19th century Jesuit Superior General Jan Roothaan, who himself published a translation and notes from the original manuscripts of St. Ignatius. The culmination of this work was a "critical edition" of the Exercises published by the Jesuit order in 1919, in the Monumenta Historica Societatis Jesu series. A critical edition from 1847 that incorporates Roothaan's studies can be found online. An authoritative Spanish-Latin text, based on the critical edition, was published in Turin by Marietti, in 1928. This was edited by the editor of the critical edition, and included convenient marginal numbers for every section, which can be found in all contemporary editions (and inline in this article). An English translation by Louis J. Puhl, S.J., published in 1951, has been widely used by Jesuits, spiritual directors, retreat leaders, and others in the English-speaking world. Puhl translated directly from studies based on the original manuscripts. BackgroundAfter recovering from a leg wound incurred during the Siege of Pamplona in 1521, Ignatius made a retreat with the Benedictine monks at their abbey high on Montserrat in Catalonia, northern Spain, where he hung up his sword before the statue of the Virgin of Montserrat. The monks introduced him to the spiritual exercises of Garcia de Cisneros, which were based in large part on the teachings of the Brothers of the Common Life, the promoters of the "devotio moderna". From Montserrat, he left for Barcelona but took a detour through the town of Manresa, where he eventually remained for several months, continuing his convalescence at a local hospital. During this time he discovered The Imitation of Christ of Thomas {\`a} Kempis, the crown jewel of the "devotio moderna", which, unlike the focus on labor in the Lord's vineyard which Ignatius will give to his Constitutions, gave little grounding for an apostolic spirituality. He also spent much of his time praying in a cave nearby, where he practiced rigorous asceticism. During this time Ignatius experienced a series of visions, and formulated the fundamentals of his Spiritual Exercises. He would later refine and complete the Exercises when he was a student in Paris. The Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius form the cornerstone of Ignatian Spirituality: a way of understanding and living one's relationship with God in the world as practiced by members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). Although he originally designed them to take place in the setting of a secluded retreat, during which those undergoing the exercises would be focused on nothing other than the Exercises, Ignatius also provided a model in his introductory notes for completing the Exercises over a longer period without the need of seclusion. The Exercises were designed to be carried out while under the guidance of a spiritual director, but they were never meant only for monks or priests: Ignatius gave the Exercises for 15 years before he was ordained, and years before the Society of Jesus was founded. He saw them as an instrument for bringing about a conversion or change of heart, in the Reformation times in which he lived. After the Society of Jesus was formed, the Exercises became the central component of its training program. They usually take place during the first year of a two-year novitiate and during a final year of spiritual studies after ordination to the priesthood. The Exercises have also impacted the founders of other religious orders, even becoming central to their work. Ignatius considered the examen, or spiritual self-review, to be the most important way to continue to live out the experience of the Exercises after their completion. Spiritual viewpointIgnatius identified the various motives that lead a person to choose one course of action over another as "spirits". A major aim of the Exercises is the development of discernment (discretio), the ability to discern between good and evil spirits. A good "spirit" can bring love, joy, peace, but also desolation, to bring one to re-examine one's life. An evil spirit usually brings confusion and doubt, but may also prompt contentment to discourage change. The human soul is continually drawn in two directions: towards goodness but at the same time towards sinfulness. According to the theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, "choice" is the center of the Exercises, and they are directed to choosing God's choice, i.e., ultimately to a self-abandonment to God. The Exercises "have as their purpose the conquest of self and the regulation of one's life in such a way that no decision is made under the influence of any inordinate attachment." Typical methodology and structureThe original, complete form of the Exercises is a retreat of about 30 days in silence and solitude. The Exercises are divided into four "weeks" of varying length with four major themes: sin and God's mercy, episodes in the life of Jesus, the passion of Jesus, and the resurrection of Jesus together with a contemplation on God's love. This last is often seen as the goal of Ignatian spirituality, to find God in all things. The "weeks" represent stages in a process of wholehearted commitment to the service of God. Daily and particular examinationMorning, afternoon, and evening will be times of the examinations. The morning is to guard against a particular sin or fault, the afternoon is a fuller examination of the same sin or defect. There will be a visual record with a tally of the frequency of sins or defects during each day. In it, the letter 'g' will indicate days, with 'G' for Sunday. Three kinds of thoughts: "my own" and two from outside, one from the "good spirit" and the other from the "bad spirit". First Week: Sin, and God's mercySecond Week: Episodes in the life of JesusThird Week: The passion of JesusFourth Week: The resurrection of Jesus, and God's love Ignatius' book is not meant to be used by the retreatant but by a director or spiritual guide. Each day the exercitant uses the material proposed by the director for four or five hour-long periods, each followed by a review of how the period went. The exercitant reports back to the spiritual director who helps interpret the exercitant's experiences and proposes material for the next day. Ignatius observes that God "deals directly" with the well-disposed person and the director should not give advice to the retreatant that might interfere with God's workings. After the first week Ignatius recommends a form of contemplation which he calls "application of the senses." For this you ``place yourself in a scene from the Gospels. Ask yourself, "What do I see? What do I hear? What do I feel, taste and smell?'' The purpose of these Exercises is that we might gain the empathy to "follow and imitate more closely our Lord." From this comes the widespread use of the Magis concept in Ignatian circles. "Discernment" is very important to Ignatian thought. Through the process of discernment, the believer is led toward a direct connection between one's thought and action and the grace of God. As such, discernment can be considered a movement toward mystical union with God, and it emphasizes the mystical experience of the believer. This aspect of the Spiritual Exercises reflects the trend toward mysticism in Catholic thought which flourished during the time of the counter-reformation (e.g., with Teresa of {\'A}vila, Francis de Sales, and Pierre de B{\'e}rulle). However, while discernment can be understood as a mystical path, it can also more prosaically be understood as a method of subjective ethical thought. The Exercises emphasize the role of one's own mental faculties in deciding what is right and wrong. Modern applicationsThe Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola are considered a classic work of spiritual literature. Many Jesuits are ready to direct the general public in retreats based on the Exercises. Since the 1980s there has been a growing interest in the Spiritual Exercises among people from other Christian traditions. The Exercises are also popular among lay people both in the Catholic Church and in other denominations, and lay organizations like the Christian life community place the Exercises at the center of their spirituality. The Exercises are seen variously as an occasion for a change of life and as a school of contemplative prayer. The most common way for laypersons to go through the Exercises now is a "retreat in daily life", which involves a five- to seven-month programme of daily prayer and meetings with a spiritual director. Also called the "19th annotation exercises" based on a remark of St. Ignatius in the 19th "introductory observation" in his book, the retreat in daily life does not require an extended stay in a retreat house and the learned methods of discernment can be tried out on day-to-day experiences over time. Also, some break the 30 days into two or three sections over a two-year period. Most retreat centers offer shorter retreats with some of the elements of the Spiritual Exercises. Retreats have been developed for specific groups of people, such as those who are married or engaged. Self-guided forms of the Exercises are also available, including online programs.},

  abstract = {Force-directed algorithm is one of the most commonly used methods for visualization of 2D graphs. These algorithms can be applied to a plethora of applications such as data visualization, social network analysis, crypto-currency transactions, and wireless sensor networks. Due to their effectiveness in visualization of topological data, various force-directed algorithms for 2D graphs were proposed in recent years. Although force-directed algorithms for 2D graphs were extensively investigated in research community, the algorithms for 3D graph visualization were rarely reported in the literature. In this paper, we propose four novel clustering-based force-directed (CFD) algorithms for visualization of 3D graphs. By using clustering algorithms, we divide a large graph into many smaller graphs so that they can be effectively processed by force-directed algorithms. In addition, weights are also introduced to further enhance the calculation for clusters. The proposed CFD algorithms are tested on 3 datasets with varying numbers of nodes. The experimental results show that proposed algorithms can significantly reduce edge crossings in visualization of large 3D graphs. The results also reveal that CFD algorithms can also reduce Kamada and Kawai energy and standardized variance of edge lengths in 3D graph visualization.},

  abstract = {Luy engages in a close reading of Bonaventure's doctrine of divine simplicity. He offers this reading in light of a keen awareness of contemporary critiques of the doctrine, especially from philosophers of religion who suggest that divine simplicity either means that our human words really cannot say anything intelligible about God, or that divine properties that are surely distinct (such as justice and goodness) are in fact absolutely identical. In sum, Luy recognizes that the doctrine of simplicity challenges the intelligibility of religious language. He points out that medieval thinkers, too, recognized this challenge, but they regarded it as a salutary reminder that God is ultimately incomprehensible to finite minds, even though we can speak true things about God. In expositing divine simplicity according to Bonaventure, Luy shows that Bonaventure expects that creation itself is designed to reveal God's limitless self-communication. Divine simplicity, then, serves to affirm divine perfection, in a manner limited by the effort of finite words to express the infinite; but divine simplicity also reflects the ``semiotic universe'' that allows for, and exalts in, the wondrous expression of the divine plenitude.},

  abstract = {The conventional computing paradigm struggles to fulfill the rapidly growing demands from emerging applications, especially those for machine intelligence because much of the power and energy is consumed by constant data transfers between logic and memory modules. A new paradigm, called ``computational random-access memory (CRAM),'' has emerged to address this fundamental limitation. CRAM performs logic operations directly using the memory cells themselves, without having the data ever leave the memory. The energy and performance benefits of CRAM for both conventional and emerging applications have been well established by prior numerical studies. However, there is a lack of experimental demonstration and study of CRAM to evaluate its computational accuracy, which is a realistic and application-critical metric for its technological feasibility and competitiveness. In this work, a CRAM array based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is experimentally demonstrated. First, basic memory operations, as well as 2-, 3-, and 5-input logic operations, are studied. Then, a 1-bit full adder with two different designs is demonstrated. Based on the experimental results, a suite of models has been developed to characterize the accuracy of CRAM computation. Scalar addition, multiplication, and matrix multiplication, which are essential building blocks for many conventional and machine intelligence applications, are evaluated and show promising accuracy performance. With the confirmation of MTJ-based CRAM's accuracy, there is a strong case that this technology will have a significant impact on power- and energy-demanding applications of machine intelligence.},

We update previous efforts to quantify the scientific consensus on climate change by searching the recent literature for papers sceptical of anthropogenic-caused global warming. From a dataset of 88125 climate-related papers published since 2012, when this question was last addressed comprehensively, we examine a randomized subset of 3000 such publications. We also use a second sample-weighted approach that was specifically biased with keywords to help identify any sceptical peer-reviewed papers in the whole dataset. We identify four sceptical papers out of the sub-set of 3000, as evidenced by abstracts that were rated as implicitly or explicitly sceptical of human-caused global warming. In our sample utilizing pre-identified sceptical keywords we found 28 papers that were implicitly or explicitly sceptical. We conclude with high statistical confidence that the scientific consensus on human-caused contemporary climate change---expressed as a proportion of the total publications---exceeds 99\% in the peer reviewed scientific literature.},

In addition, studies of brand tend to focus on highly visible or successful brands, as often as not as a proxy for a real object of analytic interest that lies elsewhere. Brand discourse defines brand in opposition to the material properties of the product, leading to a dematerialization of brand, which erases the messy materialities, contingencies, and hybrids that continually arise in the material semiosis of brand. Rather than attempt a definition of brand, the recent literature on brand semiotics is explored along several material and semiotic dimensions of the variousness of its relationship to its universes of circulation and in different professional discourses and historical and cultural contexts.},

  abstract = {This article examines two conceptualizations of time---kairic and prophetic---to illustrate the semiotic multistability of time: the Gestalt-like switch between conceptualizations. We will use two well-known novellas about time and salvation (by Charles Dickens and C. S. Lewis) to explore how the features of these two schemata cluster together thereby creating these two different understandings of time, while simultaneously blocking the view to each other. Finally, we will explore how the tensions between these two schemata are of interest for the logic of psychological science. It will be argued that many of the classic tensions within psychology speak to the multistability of our conceptual schemata regarding time and causation, something that is particularly exemplified by the challenges posed by Peirce's notion of abduction. As we opt for one vision of time, we occlude others, even as we remain aware of their presence just beyond our conceptual reach.},

A historical and ethnographic study of the environmental movement, Eco-Alchemy uncovers for the first time the profound influences of anthroposophy and its founder, Rudolf Steiner, whose holistic worldview, rooted in esoteric spirituality, inspired the movement. Dan McKanan shows that environmentalism is itself a complex ecosystem and that it would not be as diverse or transformative without the contributions of anthroposophy"--Provided by publisher},

A preview of future conditions was sought in a contemporary institution already operating at high message input levels, particularly one unable to raise the price of services in accordance with spurts in demand. A many-sided analysis of a library for research and higher education was undertaken. A set of general policies was revealed which first employed economies of scale and then, under conditions of stress, shifted costs to the executive and to the client publics. A communications channel capacity model was developed. Fourteen separate policies, combined to meet the stresses of increasing communications load, were identified. The varied effects of overloading upon spatial organization, physical equipment of central facilities, the decision pattern, morale, and the status structure are treated.},

Software proliferation challenges researchers to make informed choices about which package will be most useful for their project. This paper aims to present an information science perspective of the scholarly use of tools in qualitative research of audio-visual sources. It provides a baseline of affordances based on functionalities with the goal of making the types of research tasks that they support more explicit (e.g., transcribing, segmenting, coding, linking, and commenting on data).

  abstract = {This thesis explores the integration of embodied interactions within Human-to-Artificial Intelligence (AI) collaborative activity to support creative engagement and reduce the perception of AI as an uncontrollable, autonomous entity, also known as the AI ``black box'' rhetoric. Specifically, it investigates the utilization of kinetic sand as a sensory material and physiological data collector, facilitating the translation of users' hand motions and imprints in the sand into inputs for generative AI image creation. Informed by sociocultural frameworks of creativity, theories of embodied cognition and the positioning of AI as a statistical model, while grounded in iterative design methodologies and phenomenological analysis, the research aims to identify emergent guidelines from this collaborative creative process between humans and AI. The findings hope to contribute to the development of guidelines that inform the future design and implementation of generative AI systems for creative work. These guidelines account for embodied cognition as an essential facet of human creativity, promoting more intuitive and meaningful interactions between humans and generative AI. Ultimately, this research seeks to advance the discourse on human-AI collaboration, emphasizing the importance of embodied techniques in fostering creative synergy and mitigating the black box effect.},

  abstract = {This paper begins by presenting the theory of boundary critique, which is a key aspect of current work in the area of critical systems thinking. The theory suggests that researchers should remain aware of the need to access a diverse variety of stakeholder views in defining problems, and to `sweep in' relevant information. It also offers an understanding of how conflicts between stakeholders can become stabilised, leading to the marginalisation of some stakeholder groups and the issues that concern them. This indicates the importance of taking processes of marginalisation into account during interventions, promoting and revaluing the contributions that can be made by marginal groups. The theory of boundary critique is illustrated through a case study in which the researchers supported the multi-agency development of housing services for older people. Reflection upon this case study reveals that the principle means by which the theory of boundary critique informs intervention is through the design of methods. Methods can be developed specifically to explore the boundaries of problems. Also, the design of methods to address these problems can take account of the need to preserve the contributions of marginalised groups.},

  abstract = {Food feeds knowledge and practices through generations, sustaining biocultural memories. However, prevailing economic models and state policies have driven processes of accumulation by dispossession, defined as incremental social-ecological processes by which people lose their means of production and social reproduction. We conducted a cross-hemispherical study exploring food systems of Indigenous communities inhabiting forested landscapes in Latin America. We used mixed methods that included passive and participant observation, focus groups, free lists, food diaries, oral histories, and calendars in Mapuche communities from the Chilean Andes, and Tzotzil communities from Chiapas, Mexico. Food items and their preparations have changed in both locations. Both food systems show patterns of accumulation by dispossession associated with processes of colonial history, state policies, land privatization, soil depletion, and shifts in local food preferences. Despite these distant but comparable accumulation by dispossession processes, we advocate that biocultural memory remains linked to food-related experiences and sets the basis for dynamic and resilient local food systems going forward.},

This is done by representing some aspect of the structure of the data in a simplified topological signature. In this article, we introduce two of the most commonly used topological signatures. First, the persistence diagram represents loops and holes in the space by considering connectivity of the data points for a continuum of values rather than a single fixed value. The second topological signature, the mapper graph, returns a 1-dimensional structure representing the shape of the data, and is particularly good for exploration and visualization of the data. While these techniques are based on very sophisticated mathematics, the current ubiquity of available software means that these tools are more accessible than ever to be applied to data by researchers in education and learning, as well as all domain scientists.},

In the context of reconciliation and Indigenous resurgence, Unsettling Spirit provides a personal perspective on decolonization, informed by Indigenous traditions and lifeways, and the need to examine one's complicity with colonial structures. Applying autoethnography grounded in Indigenous and feminist methodologies, Denise Nadeau weaves together stories and reflections on how to live with integrity on stolen and occupied land. The author chronicles her early and brief experience of "Native mission" in the late 1980s and early 1990s in northern Canada and Chiapas, Mexico, and the gradual recognition that she had internalized colonialist concepts of the "good Christian" and the Great White Helper. Drawing on somatic psychotherapy, Nadeau addresses contemporary manifestations of helping and the politics of trauma. She uncovers her ancestors' settler background and the responsibilities that come with facing this history. Caught between two traditions--born and raised Catholic but challenged by Indigenous ways of life--the author traces her engagement with Indigenous values and how relationships inform her ongoing journey. A foreword by Cree-M{\'e}tis author Deanna Reder places the work in a broader context of Indigenous scholarship. Incorporating insights from Indigenous ethical and legal frameworks, Unsettling Spirit offers an accessible reflection on possibilities for settler decolonization as well as for decolonizing Christian and interfaith practice."--},

  abstract = {The more we dwell in cyberspace through our digital devices, the more disconnected we are becoming  from the real world, entering a future where people's prolonged inhabitation within virtual environments  could potentially turn major functional aspects of the built environment and its architecture obsolete.  Our homes, offices, and other places in our cities will have to compete with virtual replacements for  people's time, money, and value. Extended reality technologies can be used to design and build  cybernetic architecture to prepare for such a future. So far, architects and designers have done little  exploration of this emerging practice. This research seeks an expanded role of the built environment inside mixed reality experiences,  proposing a Context-Specific Design approach to mixed reality development that is designed for and with  the architecture in which it is situated. The proposed approach allows for a thoughtful and tailored  inclusion of spatial elements such as floor, ceiling, walls, furniture, and objects, posing as an alternative  to the commonly adopted modular design approach to mixed reality environments, which disregards the  qualities of the place and its architecture.  The thesis follows Research through Design and Speculative Design as methodologies for producing a  series of prototypes and a functional mock-up of a retail space made as a mixed reality environment.  Some design concepts, methods, techniques, and learnings emerge as core research findings.  This research furthers the discussion on the use of extended reality in architecture by proposing a new  use case for mixed reality. It also contributes to the emerging practices of cybernetic architecture and  media architecture.

In September, 2014 Thich Nhat Hanh completed a profound and beautiful new English translation of the Praj{\~n}aparamita Heart Sutra, one of the most important and well-known sutras in Buddhism. The Heart Sutra is recited daily in Mahayana temples and practice centers throughout the world. This new translation came about because Thich Nhat Hanh believes that the patriarch who originally compiled the Heart Sutra was not sufficiently skillful with his use of language to capture the intention of the Buddha's teachings--and has resulted in fundamental misunderstandings of the central tenets of Buddhism for almost 2,000 years. In The Other Shore: A New Translation of the Heart Sutra with Commentaries, Thich Nhat Hanh provides the new translation with commentaries based on his interpretation. Revealing the Buddha's original intention and insight makes clear what it means to transcend duality and pairs of opposites, such as birth and death, and to touch the ultimate reality and the wisdom of nondiscrimination. By helping to demystify the term "emptiness," the Heart Sutra is made more accessible and understandable. Prior to the publication of The Other Shore, Thich Nhat Hanh's translation and commentaries of the Heart Sutra, called The Heart of Understanding, sold more than 120,000 copies in various editions and is one of the most beloved commentaries of this critical teaching. This new book, The Other Shore, supersedes all prior translations"--},

Behaviours in other spheres of life remain understudied. In this Perspective, we propose a collaborative research agenda that integrates behavioural science insights across multiple disciplines. To this end, we offer six recommendations for optimizing the quality and impact of research on individual climate behaviour. The recommendations are united by a shift towards more solutions-focused research that is directly useful to citizens, policymakers and other change agents. Achieving this vision will require overcoming challenges such as the limited funding for behavioural and social sciences and structural barriers within and beyond the academic system that impede collaborations across disciplines.},

  abstract = {The current study assessed main effects and moderators (including emotional expressiveness, emotional processing and ambivalence over emotional expression) of the effects of expressive writing in a sample of healthy adults. Young adult participants (N = 116) were randomly assigned to write for 20 minutes on four occasions about deepest thoughts and feelings regarding their most stressful/traumatic event in the past five years (expressive writing) or about a control topic (control). Dependent variables were indicators of anxiety, depression, and physical symptoms. No significant effects of writing condition were evident on anxiety, depressive symptoms, or physical symptoms. Emotional expressiveness emerged as a significant moderator of anxiety outcomes, however. Within the expressive writing group, participants high in expressiveness evidenced a significant reduction in anxiety at three-month follow-up, and participants low in expressiveness showed a significant increase in anxiety. Expressiveness did not predict change in anxiety in the control group. These findings on anxiety are consistent with the matching hypothesis, which suggests that matching a person's naturally elected coping approach with an assigned intervention is beneficial. These findings also suggest that expressive writing about a stressful event may be contraindicated for individuals who do not typically express emotions.},

  abstract = {Axiology (from Greek ἀ{$\xi\acute{\iota}\alpha$}, axia: "value, worth"; and -{$\lambdao\gamma\acute{\iota}\alpha$}, -logia: "study of") is the philosophical study of value.  It includes questions about the nature and classification of values and about what kinds of things have value. It is intimately connected with various other philosophical fields that crucially depend on the notion of value, like ethics, aesthetics or philosophy of religion. It is also closely related to value theory and meta-ethics. The term was first used by Eduard von Hartmann in 1887 and by Paul Lapie in 1902.The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic value is central to axiology. One conceptualization holds that something is intrinsically valuable if it is good in itself or good for its own sake. It is usually held that intrinsic value depends on certain features of the valuable entity. For example, an experience may be said to be intrinsically valuable by virtue of being (because it is) pleasurable or beautiful or "true" (e.g., the ascertainment of a fact can be said to be valuable in itself). Extrinsic value, by contrast, is ascribed to things that are valuable only as a means to something else. Substantive theories of value try to determine which entities have intrinsic value. Monist theories hold that there is only one type of intrinsic value. The paradigm example of monist theories is hedonism, the thesis that only pleasure has intrinsic value. Pluralist theories, on the other hand, contend that there are various different types of intrinsic value, for example, virtue, knowledge, friendship, etc. Value pluralists face the problem of explaining whether or how the different types of value can be compared when making rational decisions. Some philosophers state that values do not exist on the most fundamental level of reality. One such view holds that a value statement about something just expresses the speaker's approval or disapproval of this thing. This position is opposed by realists about value.},

  abstract = {Colombia ( , ; Spanish: [koˈlombja] ), officially the Republic of Colombia, is a country  mostly in South America with insular regions in North America. The Colombian mainland is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the north, Venezuela to the east and northeast, Brazil to the southeast, Ecuador and Peru to the south and southwest, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and Panama to the northwest. Colombia is divided into 32 departments. The Capital District of Bogot{\'a} is also the country's largest city hosting the main financial and cultural hub. Other major urbes include Medell{\'i}n, Cali, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta, C{\'u}cuta, Ibagu{\'e}, Villavicencio and Bucaramanga. It covers an area of 1,141,748 square kilometers (440,831 sq mi) and has a population of around 52 million. Its rich cultural heritage---including language, religion, cuisine, and art---reflects its history as a colony, fusing cultural elements brought by immigration from Europe  and the Middle East, with those brought by the African diaspora, as well as with those of the various Indigenous civilizations that predate colonization. Spanish is the official language, although Creole English and 64 other languages are recognized regionally. Colombia has been home to many indigenous peoples and cultures since at least 12,000 BCE. The Spanish first landed in La Guajira in 1499, and by the mid-16th century, they had colonized much of present-day Colombia, and established the New Kingdom of Granada, with Santa F{\'e} de Bogot{\'a} as its capital. Independence from the Spanish Empire was achieved in 1819, with what is now Colombia emerging as the United Provinces of New Granada. The new polity experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation (1858) and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before becoming a republic---the current Republic of Colombia---in 1886. With the backing of the United States and France, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, resulting in Colombia's present borders. Beginning in the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence, both of which escalated in the 1990s. Since 2005, there has been significant improvement in security, stability, and rule of law, as well as unprecedented economic growth and development. Colombia is recognized for its healthcare system, being the best healthcare in Latin America according to the World Health Organization and 22nd in the world. Its diversified economy is the third-largest in South America, with macroeconomic stability and favorable long-term growth prospects.Colombia is one of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries; it has the highest level of biodiversity per square mile in the world and the second-highest level overall. Its territory encompasses Amazon rainforest, highlands, grasslands and deserts. It is the only country in South America with coastlines (and islands) along both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Colombia is a key member of major global and regional organizations including the UN, the WTO, the OECD, the OAS, the Pacific Alliance and the Andean Community; it is also a NATO Global Partner and a major non-NATO ally of the United States.},

DM45): "EVERYTHING IS DEEPLY INTERTWINGLED. In an important sense there are no "subjects" at all; there is only all knowledge, since the cross-connections among the myriad topics of this world simply cannot be divided up neatly."He added the following comment in the revised edition  (Nelson 1987, p. DM31): "Hierarchical and sequential structures, especially popular since Gutenberg, are usually forced and artificial. Intertwingularity is not generally acknowledged---people keep pretending they can make things hierarchical, categorizable and sequential when they can't."Intertwingularity is related to Nelson's coined term hypertext, partially inspired by "As We May Think" (1945) by Vannevar Bush.},

More persistent features are detected over a wide range of spatial scales and are deemed more likely to represent true features of the underlying space rather than artifacts of sampling, noise, or particular choice of parameters. To find the persistent homology of a space, the space must first be represented as a simplicial complex. A distance function on the underlying space corresponds to a filtration of the simplicial complex, that is a nested sequence of increasing subsets. One common method of doing this is via taking the sublevel filtration of the distance to a point cloud, or equivalently, the offset filtration on the point cloud and taking its nerve in order to get the simplicial filtration known as {\v C}ech filtration. A similar construction uses a nested sequence of Vietoris--Rips complexes known as the Vietoris--Rips filtration.},

As well, persistent bias in the language used for subject headings, as well as the hierarchy of classification for books in these fields, continues to ``other'' the peoples and topics that populate these titles.

  abstract = {The contemporary notion of professional competence is not grounded in an adequate notion of civil society. Professional practice tends to put citizens in a situation of incompetence, even when it is supposed to serve them. In a civil society, this is not an acceptable state of affairs. In a civil society, the ultimate source of legitimacy lies with the citizen; hence a reflective professional practice that is grounded in an adequate concept of civil society should give citizens a meaningful, and competent, role to play. Reflective practice, then, depends on competent citizenship. There is a need for a simultaneous revision of the contemporary concepts of professional competence and of citizenship. Professional practice and the practice of citizenship need to be understood in such a way that professionals and citizens can meet as equals, though not necessarily as equally skilled individuals. Methodologically speaking, this is possible if we can show that there exists a common core of competencies that both sides can contribute to reflective practice. This paper finds such a core competence in the new concept of critically systemic thinking. The author introduces some of its basic ideas and explains why they might become the source of a new critical competence for citizens as well as for professionals.}

In fact, from a systemic design approach, the system to be designed, its context with its relationships and its environment receive synchronous attention. Systemic design's discourse has been developed through Relating Systems Thinking and Design---a series of symposia held annually since 2012.},

  abstract = {A revealing look at how negative biases against women of color are embedded in search engine results and algorithms Run a Google search for "black girls"--what will you find? "Big Booty" and other sexually explicit terms are likely to come up as top search terms. But, if you type in "white girls," the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about "why black women are so sassy" or "why black women are so angry" presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society. In Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color. Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance--operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond--understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance. An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.},

  abstract = {As complexity in human social-technical systems grows so does the need to provide useable guidance for how to effectively create change within them. A design-driven approach to evaluation draws on lessons from complexity science and incorporates service and product design knowledge into the process of creating and implementing new knowledge or actions into a setting to produce value (innovation). This article introduces the fundamental tenets of a design-driven evaluation (DDE) approach and illustrates its use in developing frameworks for evaluation that can support innovation and program development. Drawing on the science of systems and their application to evaluation, Developmental and Principles-focused Evaluation, and systems-oriented design theory and practice, a model for innovation development is proposed that will reframe program evaluation as both a service and product to aid system change.},

  abstract = {Simplicial Kuramoto models have emerged as a diverse and intriguing class of models describing oscillators on simplices rather than nodes. In this paper, we present a unified framework to describe different variants of these models, categorized into three main groups: ``simple'' models, ``Hodge-coupled'' models, and ``order-coupled'' (Dirac) models. Our framework is based on topology and discrete differential geometry, as well as gradient systems and frustrations, and permits a systematic analysis of their properties. We establish an equivalence between the simple simplicial Kuramoto model and the standard Kuramoto model on pairwise networks under the condition of manifoldness of the simplicial complex. Then, starting from simple models, we describe the notion of simplicial synchronization and derive bounds on the coupling strength necessary or sufficient for achieving it. For some variants, we generalize these results and provide new ones, such as the controllability of equilibrium solutions. Finally, we explore a potential application in the reconstruction of brain functional connectivity from structural connectomes and find that simple edge-based Kuramoto models perform competitively or even outperform complex extensions of node-based models.},

Textual analysis reveals that basic tenets of subject access-user-focused cataloguing, objectivity, and standardization-are problematized in the literature and may be the best starting point for future research.

These processes are especially visible in anti-branding movements where reflexive consumers organize to reject, protest and campaign against particular brand values, often by using other brands to devise and enact counter-brand strategies. Drawing on research on consumer resistance we identify the critical reflexive consumer caught in a paradoxical tension between anti-branding and branding structures. An analysis applying the semiotic square is presented to reveal the underlying logical structure of brand and anti-brand meaning for two brands: Blackspot by Adbusters and the tobacco brand with no name from the Danish company Mac Baren. Our analysis shows how strategic brand management has successfully incorporated and responded to anti-brand structures, and suggests some reasons why conventional anti-brand campaigning might not be effective. Beneath explicit articulations and intentions anti-brand logic actually affirms the centrality of brands and commodities in consumer culture.},

It is robust to perturbations of input data, independent of dimensions and coordinates, and provides a compact representation of the qualitative features of the input. The computation of PH is an open area with numerous important and fascinating challenges. The field of PH computation is evolving rapidly, and new algorithms and software implementations are being updated and released at a rapid pace. The purposes of our article are to (1) introduce theory and computational methods for PH to a broad range of computational scientists and (2) provide benchmarks of state-of-the-art implementations for the computation of PH. We give a friendly introduction to PH, navigate the pipeline for the computation of PH with an eye towards applications, and use a range of synthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate currently available open-source implementations for the computation of PH. Based on our benchmarking, we indicate which algorithms and implementations are best suited to different types of data sets. In an accompanying tutorial, we provide guidelines for the computation of PH. We make publicly available all scripts that we wrote for the tutorial, and we make available the processed version of the data sets used in the benchmarking.},

After presenting an overview of their particular conceptions of change, narratives of change and foci of interventions, we comparatively assess: i) the dynamics of societal change that they highlight; ii) the scopes of change that they target and iii) the phases of change with which they actively engage. Our findings suggest that DfST, TTs and PT undertake distinct and yet equally relevant and necessary lenses and practices to understand and steer sustainability transitions. We argue that there is a need for establishing dialogues and collaborations between these three approaches, linking their activities, processes, learnings and propositions in order to initiate the formation of an aligned sustainability transitions research.},

Without new language---novel distinctions and relations in a shared belief system embracing goals and values---innovation is limited to improvements upon existing processes. But all our unmet business, industrial, technological and societal challenges will not surrender to incremental change. These complex challenges bridge ``systems of systems'' across multiple domains and individual vocabularies. By their nature, they require the invention of new language for them to be reframed and, possibly, to be tamed. But how does new language emerge? How can it be fostered when deep innovation in systems of systems requires design collaboration across diverse prior languages? Can we do better than optimistic but undisciplined approaches such as ``randomized diversity'', ``hyper-connectivity'', and ``open innovation''? In response to techniques in vogue, Pangaro will present conceptual frames and project examples that propose a conversational methodology of innovation by design.

  abstract = {In this work we propose a method and algorithm for identifying the pathways for meaning circulation within a text. This is done by visualizing normalized textual data as a graph and deriving the key metrics for the concepts and for the text as a whole using network analysis. The resulting data and graph representation are then used to detect the key concepts, which function as junctions for meaning circulation within a text, contextual clusters comprised of word communities (themes), as well as the most often used pathways for meaning circulation. We then discuss several practical applications of our method ranging from automatic recovery of hidden agendas within a text and intertextual navigation graph-interfaces, to enhancing reading and writing, quick text summarization, as well as group sentiment profiling and text diagramming. We also make a quick overview of the existing computer-assisted text analysis (and, specifically, network text analysis), and text visualization methods in order to position our research in relation to the other available approaches.},

Axel Vervoordt's intense curiosity has fueled his work as an interior designer, spurring him to explore and draw inspiration from cultures around the globe. He was first exposed to Eastern art and philosophy years ago, but today it has become the guiding principle in his work, particularly the concept of Wabi. Developed in the twelfth century, Wabi advocates simplicity and humility, the rejection of all that is superfluous or artificial. Through extraordinary photographs from Japan and Korea to Belgium and Switzerland, Vervoordt invites us to explore the elements that inspire him: natural materials and time-worn objects that evoke the essence of Wabi. Today, together with the Japanese architect Tatsuro Miki, Vervoordt carries the principles of Wabi into his remarkable interiors. As Vervoordt reveals how he infuses his current creations with a fundamentally oriental approach, interiors devotees will gain new insight from this tribute to the designer's latest sources of inspiration for the home},

With the immanent emergence of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) and the illusory temptations of 'transhumanism', mankind stands at a crossroads. In Humanity's Last Stand, Nicanor Perlas makes an urgent plea. It is imperative, he says, that we take immediate steps to ensure that digitized technology is aligned to human values and priorities. Otherwise, ASI will kill the essence of our humanity. Further, if we do not master it now, ASI will transform mankind into its own image. Ultimately, it will destroy the human race.AI experts have not offered a single cogent solution to this existential threat. Rudolf Steiner, however, not only foresaw these developments, but gave clear alternatives. Steiner, the founder of a contemporary, scientific approach to spirituality, provided philosophical, ontological and social innovations to save humanity from the abyss. It is the task of the global anthroposophical movement to pioneer this civilization-saving work: to establish spiritual-scientific ideas in mainstream culture that would allow AI to emerge in a healthier societal context.Perlas gives an overview of the phenomenon of AI together with its related transhuman concepts of 'perfecting humanity', and outlines the critical internal and external responses required to meet them with consciousness. In particular, he addresses the movement connected to the work of Rudolf Steiner, indicating its all-important tasks: to cooperate with progressive individuals and movements, including scientists and civil society activists; to mobilize its 'daughter' movements for action; and, ultimately, to cooperate with the spiritual powers that have guided and served humanity since the dawn of time. This, says the author, is humanity's last stand, and failure is not an option."--page 4 of cover.},

  abstract = {The statistical mechanical approach to complex networks is the dominant paradigm in describing natural and societal complex systems. The study of network properties, and their implications on dynamical processes, mostly focus on locally defined quantities of nodes and edges, such as node degrees, edge weights and --more recently-- correlations between neighboring nodes. However, statistical methods quickly become cumbersome when dealing with many-body properties and do not capture the precise mesoscopic structure of complex networks. Here we introduce a novel method, based on persistent homology, to detect particular non-local structures, akin to weighted holes within the link-weight network fabric, which are invisible to existing methods. Their properties divide weighted networks in two broad classes: one is characterized by small hierarchically nested holes, while the second displays larger and longer living inhomogeneities. These classes cannot be reduced to known local or quasilocal network properties, because of the intrinsic non-locality of homological properties, and thus yield a new classification built on high order coordination patterns. Our results show that topology can provide novel insights relevant for many-body interactions in social and spatial networks. Moreover, this new method creates the first bridge between network theory and algebraic topology, which will allow to import the toolset of algebraic methods to complex systems.},

Although climate change may cause direct psychological and existential impacts, vast numbers of people already experience indirect impacts in the form of depression, socio-ethical paralysis, and loss of well-being. This is not always evident, because people have developed psychological and social defenses in response, including ``socially constructed silence.'' I argue that this situation causes the need to frame climate change narratives as emphasizing hope in the midst of tragedy. Framing the situation simply as a threat or a possibility does not work. Religious communities and the use of methods which include spirituality have an important role in enabling people to process their deep emotions and existential questions. I draw also from my experiences from Finland in enabling cooperation between natural scientists and theologians in order to address climate issues.},

Digital humanities stands greatly to impact the Information and Library Science (ILS) professions (and vice versa) as well as the traditional humanities disciplines. This paper explores the contours of digital humanities as a field, touching upon fundamental issues related to the field's coalescence and thus to its structure and epistemology. It looks at the ways in which digital humanities brings new approaches and sheds new light on manifold humanities foci. Digital humanities work represents a vital new current of interdisciplinary, collaborative intellectual activity both in- and outside the academy; it merits particular attention from ILS. This paper helps potential stakeholders understand the intellectual and practical framework of the digital humanities and ``its relationship'' to their own intellectual and professional work. This paper critically synthesizes previous scholarly work in digital humanities. It has particular value for those in ILS, a community that has proven especially receptive to the field, as well as to scholars working in many humanities disciplines. Digital humanities has already made an important impact on both LIS and the humanities; its impact is sure to grow.},

  abstract = {Purpose In Digging into Data 3 (DID3) (2014-2016), ten funders from four countries (the USA, Canada, the UK, and the Netherlands) granted \$5.1 million to 14 project teams to pursue data-intensive, interdisciplinary, and international digital humanities (DH) research. The purpose of this paper is to employ the DID3 projects as a case study to explore the following research question: what roles do librarians and archivists take on in data-intensive, interdisciplinary, and international DH projects? Participation was secured from 53 persons representing eleven projects. The study was conducted in the naturalistic paradigm. It is a qualitative case study involving snowball sampling, semi-structured interviews, and grounded analysis. Librarians or archivists were involved officially in 3 of the 11 projects (27.3 percent). Perhaps more importantly, information professionals played vital unofficial roles in these projects, namely as consultants and liaisons and also as technical support. Information and library science (ILS) expertise helped DID3 researchers with issues such as visualization, rights management, and user testing. DID3 participants also suggested ways in which librarians and archivists might further support DH projects, concentrating on three key areas: curation, outreach, and ILS education. Finally, six directions for future research are suggested. Much untapped potential exists for librarians and archivists to collaborate with DH scholars; a gap exists between researcher awareness and information professionals' capacity.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Analogous to biological sequence comparison, comparing cellular networks is an important problem that could provide insight into biological understanding and therapeutics. For technical reasons, comparing large networks is computationally infeasible, and thus heuristics, such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, diameter, and relative graphlet frequency distribution have been sought. It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by simply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much harder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating their similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is computationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger the number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more likely it is that the networks will truly be similar.Results: We introduce a new systematic measure of a network's local structure that imposes a large number of similarity constraints on networks being compared. In particular, we generalize the degree distribution, which measures the number of nodes `touching' k edges, into distributions measuring the number of nodes `touching' k graphlets, where graphlets are small connected non-isomorphic subgraphs of a large network. Our new measure of network local structure consists of 73 graphlet degree distributions of graphlets with 2--5 nodes, but it is easily extendible to a greater number of constraints (i.e. graphlets), if necessary, and the extensions are limited only by the available CPU. Furthermore, we show a way to combine the 73 graphlet degree distributions into a network `agreement' measure which is a number between 0 and 1, where 1 means that networks have identical distributions and 0 means that they are far apart. Based on this new network agreement measure, we show that almost all of the 14 eukaryotic PPI networks, including human, resulting from various high-throughput experimental techniques, as well as from curated databases, are better modeled by geometric random graphs than by Erd{\"o}s--R{\'e}ny, random scale-free, or Barab{\'a}si--Albert scale-free networks.Availability: Software executables are available upon request.Contact: ~natasha@ics.uci.edu},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Networks have been used to model many real-world phenomena to better understand the phenomena and to guide experiments in order to predict their behavior. Since incorrect models lead to incorrect predictions, it is vital to have as accurate a model as possible. As a result, new techniques and models for analyzing and modeling real-world networks have recently been introduced.             Results: One example of large and complex networks involves protein--protein interaction (PPI) networks. We analyze PPI networks of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster using a newly introduced measure of local network structure as well as the standardly used measures of global network structure. We examine the fit of four different network models, including Erd{\"o}s-R{\'e}nyi, scale-free and geometric random network models, to these PPI networks with respect to the measures of local and global network structure. We demonstrate that the currently accepted scale-free model of PPI networks fails to fit the data in several respects and show that a random geometric model provides a much more accurate model of the PPI data. We hypothesize that only the noise in these networks is scale-free.             Conclusions: We systematically evaluate how well-different network models fit the PPI networks. We show that the structure of PPI networks is better modeled by a geometric random graph than by a scale-free model.

Through the lens of this empirical project, three methodological questions that an alliance between ANT and feminism would raise for any research project are considered: 1) Where does the analysis start? 2) What can be seen once the research has begun? 3) What about politics? The potential places where ANT and feminism can meet and mutually shape research on scientific practice and technological innovation are explored. In doing so, this paper moves toward an imagining of a feminist ANT.},

Measurement of Er in Tris+-substituted, Na-free medium also indicated a permeability to Tris+ ions. Unlike adult frog muscle the magnitude of Er was insensitive to change in external Ca++ (up to 30 mM) or to changes in external pH (between 6.4 and 8.9). The equivalent circuit equation describing the electrical circuit composed of two parallel ionic batteries (EK and ENa) and their respective conductances (gK and gNa), which has been generally useful in describing the Er of adult rat and frog muscle, could also be applied to rat myotubes when Er was measured over a wide range of external Na+ concentrations. The equivalent circuit equation could not be applied to myotubes bathed in media of different external K+ concentrations. In this case, the Er was more closely described by the Goldman constant field equation. Under certain circumstances, it is known that the receptor in adult rat and frog muscle can be induced to reversibly shift from behavior described by the equivalent circuit equation to that described by the Goldman equation. Attempts to similarly manipulate the responses of cultured rat myotubes were unsussessful. These trials included a reduction in temperature (15 degress C), partial alpha-bungarotoxin blodkade, and activation of responses with the cholinergic agonist, decamethonium.},

The contributors, including Sanford Berman, Thomas Mann, and numerous front-line library workers, address topics ranging from criticisms of the state of the profession and traditional Library of Congress cataloging to methods of making cataloging more inclusive and helpful to library users. Other essay topics include historical overviews of cataloging practices and the literature they generate, first-person discussions of library workers' experiences with cataloging or metadata work, and the implications behind what materials get cataloged, who catalogs them, and how. Several essays provide a critical overview of innovative cataloging practices and the ways that such practices have been successfully integrated in many of the nation's leading libraries."--Publisher's description.},

This allows us to show that under a mild condition a fully faithful and essentially surjective functor between such topological categories induces a homotopy equivalence of classifying spaces. It follows from this that we can associate a 2-functorial homotopy type to a wide class of topological stacks of categories, taking values in the 2-category of spaces, continuous maps and homotopy classes of homotopies of maps. This generalises work of Noohi and Ebert on the homotopy types of topological stacks of groupoids under the restriction to the site with numerable open covers.},

The contributors explore the intersections between music, modernity, and Indigeneity in essays addressing topics that range from hip-hop to powwow, and television soundtracks of Native Classical and experimental music. Working from the shared premise that multiple modernities exist for Indigenous peoples, the authors seek to understand contemporary musical expression from Native perspectives and to decolonize the study of Native American/First Nations music. The essays coalesce around four main themes: innovative technology, identity formation and self-representation, political activism, and translocal musical exchange. Closely related topics include cosmopolitanism, hybridity, alliance studies, code-switching, and ontologies of sound. Featuring the work of both established and emerging scholars, the collection demonstrates the centrality of music in communicating the complex, diverse lived experience of Indigenous North Americans in the twenty-first century and brings ethnomusicology into dialogue with critical Indigenous studies.},

ML can accelerate the solution of intricate chemical problems and even solve problems that otherwise would not be tractable. However, the potential benefits of ML come at the cost of big data production; that is, the algorithms demand large volumes of data of various natures and from different sources, from material properties to sensor data. In the survey, we propose a roadmap for future developments with emphasis on computer-aided discovery of new materials and analysis of chemical sensing compounds, both prominent research fields for ML in the context of materials science. In addition to providing an overview of recent advances, we elaborate upon the conceptual and practical limitations of big data and ML applied to materials science, outlining processes, discussing pitfalls, and reviewing cases of success and failure.},

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden' units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

Artefactual materials or objects (such as buildings) should appeal to the people of Africa and solve their daily challenges. Using semiotics, this paper cautions innovators, planners, thinkers and producers of ``modern'' residential homes; that these, as material objects, have other roles they play. Dwellings assume the heritage of a people far removed from the traditionally thought spaces and objects such as drums, museums, songs, literary texts, pieces of cloth and so on. As such, planners have a mandate to deliberately uphold their people's cultural sensitivity if sustainable development is to mean in Zimbabwe and Africa in general.},

  abstract = {The enduring legacy of Euclidean geometry underpins classical machine learning, which, for decades, has been primarily developed for data lying in Euclidean space. Yet, modern machine learning increasingly encounters richly structured data that is inherently nonEuclidean. This data can exhibit intricate geometric, topological and algebraic structure: from the geometry of the curvature of space-time, to topologically complex interactions between neurons in the brain, to the algebraic transformations describing symmetries of physical systems. Extracting knowledge from such non-Euclidean data necessitates a broader mathematical perspective. Echoing the 19th-century revolutions that gave rise to non-Euclidean geometry, an emerging line of research is redefining modern machine learning with non-Euclidean structures. Its goal: generalizing classical methods to unconventional data types with geometry, topology, and algebra. In this review, we provide an accessible gateway to this fast-growing field and propose a graphical taxonomy that integrates recent advances into an intuitive unified framework. We subsequently extract insights into current challenges and highlight exciting opportunities for future development in this field.},

  abstract = {We are flooded with large-scale, dynamic, directed, networked data. Analyses requiring exact comparisons between networks are computationally intractable, so new methodologies are sought. To analyse directed networks, we extend graphlets (small induced sub-graphs) and their degrees to directed data. Using these directed graphlets, we generalise state-of-the-art network distance measures (RGF, GDDA and GCD) to directed networks and show their superiority for comparing directed networks. Also, we extend the canonical correlation analysis framework that enables uncovering the relationships between the wiring patterns around nodes in a directed network and their expert annotations. On directed World Trade Networks (WTNs), our methodology allows uncovering the core-broker-periphery structure of the WTN, predicting the economic attributes of a country, such as its gross domestic product, from its wiring patterns in the WTN for up-to ten years in the future. It does so by enabling us to track the dynamics of a country's positioning in the WTN over years. On directed metabolic networks, our framework yields insights into preservation of enzyme function from the network wiring patterns rather than from sequence data. Overall, our methodology enables advanced analyses of directed networked data from any area of science, allowing domain-specific interpretation of a directed network's topology.},

  abstract = {Recent suggestions urge advancing Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) to provide the overdue support tools for individuals in the envisaged Knowledge Societies. To point out essential issues to be addressed, the paper proposes a PKM for Development (PKM4D) framework as a substantial extension of a current framework focusing on ICT4D (Information and Communications Technologies for Development). Closely aligned to Maslow's Extended Hierarchy of Needs, it allows for a differentiated assessment of knowledge management related innovations and interventions and their impact on six ecosystems related to technology, extelligence, society, knowledge workers, institutions, and the ideosphere. The framework is a spin-off of a design science research project aiming to introduce a novel PKM concept and system. The objective of this paper is to provide a motivation and more general narrative for employing the PKM4D framework in other developmental contexts in order to address opportunity divides independent of space (e.g. developed/developing countries), time (e.g. study or career phase), discipline (e.g. natural or social science), or role (e.g. student, professional, or leader). With a prototype about to be converted into a viable PKM system (PKMS) and in following up on prior concept and design related articles, the PKMS is not the prime focus of attention but serves as an example case of a novel intervention to be assessed and validated by applying the PKM4D framework and its twelve criteria.},

In keeping with this model, more and more governments are prioritizing greater public involvement in innovation processes. The goal of this study was to identify desirable and productive forms of interaction between the scientific community and the public. Our analysis focuses on the point of view of societal actors, which has so far been largely neglected in scientific literature and political discourse. To this end, we interviewed 50 laypersons with participatory research and innovation experience in Germany to document their opinions of the value of such interaction, the goals it should pursue, and the forms it should take. Rather than preferring the democratization of science in general, interviewees expressed the desire for more extensive opportunities to introduce scientific and technological considerations as part of bidirectional exchanges between academia and society. This paper proposes a layperson typology intended to help design participatory processes that facilitate such exchanges and includes the differences in opinions between men and women.},

  abstract = {Designers and design is facing ever growing challenges from an increasingly complex world. Making design matter means to cope with these challenges and to be able to enter new important design fields where design can play a crucial role. To achieve this we need to become better at coping with super-complexity. Systems Oriented Design is a new version of systems thinking and systems practice that is developed from within design thinking and design practice. It is systems thinking and systems practice tailored by and for designers. It draws from designerly ways of dealing with super-complexity derived from supreme existing design practices as well as refers to established perspectives in modern systems thinking, especially Soft Systems Methodology, Critical Systems Thinking and Systems Architecting. Further on it is based on design skills like visual thinking and visualisation in processes and for communication purposes. Most central are the emerging techniques of GIGA-mapping. GIGA-mapping is super extensive mapping across multiple layers and scales, investigating relations between seemingly separated categories and so implementing boundary critique to the conception and framing of systems. In this paper we will present the concept of GIGAmapping and systematize and exemplify its different variations.},

  abstract = {Data analysis techniques from network science have fundamentally improved our understanding of neural systems and the complex behaviors that they support. Yet the restriction of network techniques to the study of pairwise interactions prevents us from taking into account intrinsic topological features such as cavities that may be crucial for system function. To detect and quantify these topological features, we must turn to algebro-topological methods that encode data as a simplicial complex built from sets of interacting nodes called simplices. We then use the relations between simplices to expose cavities within the complex, thereby summarizing its topological features. Here we provide an introduction to persistent homology, a fundamental method from applied topology that builds a global descriptor of system structure by chronicling the evolution of cavities as we move through a combinatorial object such as a weighted network. We detail the mathematics and perform demonstrative calculations on the mouse structural connectome, synapses in C. elegans, and genomic interaction data. Finally, we suggest avenues for future work and highlight new advances in mathematics ready for use in neural systems., For the network neuroscientist, this exposition aims to communicate both the mathematics and the advantages of using tools from applied topology for the study of neural systems. Using data from the mouse connectome, electrical and chemical synapses in C. elegans, and chromatin interaction data, we offer example computations and applications to further demonstrate the power of topological data analysis in neuroscience. Finally, we expose the reader to novel developments in applied topology and relate these developments to current questions and methodological difficulties in network neuroscience.},

  abstract = {Significant technological advances made in recent years have shepherded a dramatic increase in utilization of digital technologies for biomedicine- everything from the widespread use of electronic health records to improved medical imaging capabilities and the rising ubiquity of genomic sequencing contribute to a "digitization" of biomedical research and clinical care. With this shift toward computerized tools comes a dramatic increase in the amount of available data, and current tools for data analysis capable of extracting meaningful knowledge from this wealth of information have yet to catch up. This article seeks to provide an overview of emerging mathematical methods with the potential to improve the abilities of clinicians and researchers to analyze biomedical data, but may be hindered from doing so by a lack of conceptual accessibility and awareness in the life sciences research community. In particular, we focus on topological data analysis (TDA), a set of methods grounded in the mathematical field of algebraic topology that seeks to describe and harness features related to the "shape" of data. We aim to make such techniques more approachable to non-mathematicians by providing a conceptual discussion of their theoretical foundations followed by a survey of their published applications to scientific research. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these methods and suggest potential avenues for future work integrating mathematical tools into clinical care and biomedical informatics.},

In the first book to examine one of the most peculiar features of one of the greatest and most perplexing poems of England’s late Middle Ages—the successive attempts of Piers Plowman to begin, and to keep beginning—D. Vance Smith compels us to rethink beginning, as concept and practice, in both medieval and contemporary terms.The problem of beginning was invested with increasing urgency in the fourteenth century, imagined and grappled with in the courts, the churches, the universities, the workshops, the fields, and the streets of England. The Book of the Incipit reveals how Langland’s poem exemplifies a widespread interest in beginning in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, an interest that appears in such divergent fields as the physics of motion, the measurement of time, logic, grammar, rhetoric, theology, book production, and insurrection. Smith offers a theoretical understanding of beginning that departs from the structuralisms of Edward Said and the traditional formalisms of A. D. Nuttall and most medievalist and modernist treatments of closure. Instead, he conceives a work’s beginning as a figure of the beginning of the work itself, the inception of language as the problem of beginning to which we continue to return.},

In his own time his influence was acknowledged by the majorscientists of the day, such as John Herschel, Charles Darwin, CharlesLyell and Michael Faraday, who frequently turned to Whewell forphilosophical and scientific advice, and, interestingly, forterminological assistance. Whewell invented the terms``anode,'' ``cathode,'' and ``ion'' forFaraday. In response to a challenge by the poet S.T. Coleridge in1833, Whewell invented the English word ``scientist;''before this time the only terms in use in that language were``natural philosopher'' and ``man of science''.Whewell was greatly influenced by his association with three of hisfellow students at Cambridge: Charles Babbage, John Herschel, andRichard Jones. Over the winter of 1812 and spring of 1813, the fourmet for what they called ``Philosophical Breakfasts'' atwhich they discussed induction and scientific method.

This study also promotes an informed approach toward using GANs with a focus on domain-specific requirements of Islamic calligraphy. Some of the potentials of using GANs in Islamic calligraphy are depicted through analyzing the results of a GAN trained on a custom-made and regularized dataset of nasta'l{\=i}q script.

Findings show an overuse of signs within the slogans of regional governments that weakened the delivery of information regarding local identity. A leading slogan for a large region may create a unique identity in relative terms, whereas second-tier regions tend to mimic the success of others. The present research illustrates that each region of Korea cannot be differentiated in terms of a semantic analysis of linguistic signs. The communication tendencies that influence the creation of slogans for Korean regions are morphologically complex but semantically simple, resulting in the failure of these regions to secure distinctiveness in their individual brand identities.},

  abstract = {In the course of a systematic screening of sera from dogs suffering from autoimmune disorders, three sera were shown by indirect immunofluorescence to characteristically label the nucleoli and nucleoplasm of human cell lines (Hep-2 and HeLa). This pattern of staining persisted throughout the cell cycle, except for mitosis when the fluorescence was localized in extrachromosomal areas. By immunoblotting nuclear and subnuclear fractions, three polypeptides of 110,000, 95,000, and 45,000 Da apparent molecular weight were identified, which reacted with all three sera. By means of affinity purification, it was shown that an antibody specific for any one of the three proteins also reacts with the two others. This antigenic cross-reactivity suggested regions of structural homology shared by the three proteins. Indeed, treatment of nucleoli with high concentrations of DNase I containing residual proteolytic activity resulted in the disappearance of the 110- and 95-kDa proteins and the concomitant appearance of a doublet of 45-kDa proteins. Subnuclear localization studies indicated that all three polypeptides were located in both nucleoli and nucleoplasm. Significantly, the 110-kDa protein differs from the major nucleolar protein, nucleolin, by its electrophoretic mobility in two-dimensional gels, its location in nucleoli and in nucleoplasm, its absence in nucleolar organizer regions of chromosomes, and its differential solubility of DNase I. Therefore, the three antigenically related species reported in this study constitute a new class of nucleolar proteins.},

But their best-laid plans are overwhelmed by the inevitable change, growth, innovation, progress, evolution, diversity, and entropy. When the Acad{\'e}mie Fran{\c c}aise attempted to legislate the vocabulary and definitions of the French language, their efforts were undermined by uncontrollable developments: rapid growth of slang that is never sanctioned by the authorities, and wholesale borrowing of words from English, the world's fastest growing language. In Japan, the pace of innovation and borrowing has been so rapid that the older generation of Japanese can no longer read their daily newspapers. These changes, which create difficulties for people, are far more disruptive for the fragile databases and knowledge bases in computer systems. The term knowledge soup better characterizes the fluid, dynamically changing nature of the information that people learn, reason about, act upon, and communicate. This talk addresses the complexity of the knowledge soup, the problems it poses for intelligent systems, and the methods for managing it. The most important measure for any intelligent system is its flexibility in accommodating and making sense of the knowledge soup.},

  abstract = {The task of knowledge representation has two parts: the first is to analyze some body of knowledge and identify the relevant concepts, relations, and assumptions; the second is to translate the result of the analysis into some notation that can be processed by computer. Neither part is easy, but the first is far more difficult. Natural languages are capable of expressing anything that can be stated in any artificial language with the same level of detail and precision, but they can tolerate any degree of vagueness during the process of analysis. Artificial languages, such as the many variants of symbolic logic, are valuable because they do not tolerate vagueness, but what they say so precisely may have no relationship to what the author intended. The various notations for logic are designed to represent the final precise stage, but they provide no intermediate forms that can bridge the gap between an initial vague idea and its ultimate formalization. Natural languages can represent every stage from the most vague to the most precise, but no version of fuzzy logic or related variants can come close to the flexibility of natural languages. The vagueness is not caused by natural language, but by the fact that people seldom have a clear idea of what they want to say before the analysis has been completed. Engineers have a pithy characterization of the phenomenon: ``Customers never know what they want until they see what they get.'' Plato's dialogs illustrate the kind of analysis that is required. Similar dialogs are necessary when programmers or engineers analyze a vague wish list (also called a requirements document) in order to generate a formal specification. Those dialogs always take place in natural languages, often supplemented with hastily scribbled diagrams, but not in any version of logic, fuzzy or precise. This talk discusses a range of representations from informal to formal and compares four notations that are being used in various stages of knowledge acquisition, analysis, and representation: the informal Concept Maps, the semiformalized Topic Maps, the formal Conceptual Graphs, and the formal, but highly readable Common Logic Controlled English (CLCE). These and other similar notations have found useful niches in the process of analysis and representation, but it is important to recognize their different characteristics and areas of applicability. The following slides were presented in the track on Technology, Instruction, Cognition and Learning (TICL) at the AERA Conference, San Francisco, 10 April 2006.},

Several versions of CGs have been designed and implemented over the past thirty years. The simplest are the typeless core CGs, which correspond to Peirce's original existential graphs. More common are the extended CGs, which are a typed superset of the core. The research CGs have explored novel techniques for reasoning, knowledge representation, and natural language semantics. The semantics of the core and extended CGs is defined by a formal mapping to and from the ISO standard for Common Logic, but the research CGs are defined by a variety of formal and informal extensions. This article surveys the notation, applications, and reasoning methods used with CGs and their mapping to and from other versions of logic.},

  title = {Conceptual {{Graphs For Representing Conceptual Structures}}},
  author = {Sowa, John F.},
  abstract = {A conceptual graph (CG) is a graph representation for logic based on the semantic networks of artificial intelligence and the existential graphs of Charles Sanders Peirce. CG design principles emphasize the requirements for a cognitive representation: a smooth mapping to and from natural languages; an ``iconic'' structure for representing patterns of percepts in visual and tactile imagery; and cognitively realistic operations for perception, reasoning, and language understanding. The regularity and simplicity of the graph structures also support efficient algorithms for searching, pattern matching, and reasoning. Different subsets of conceptual graphs have different levels of expressive power: the ISO standard conceptual graphs express the full semantics of Common Logic (CL), which includes the subset used for the Semantic Web languages; a larger CG subset adds a context notation to support metalanguage and modality; and the research CGs are exploring an open-ended variety of extensions for aspects of natural language semantics. Unlike most notations for logic, CGs can be used with a continuous range of precision: at the formal end, they are equivalent to classical logic; but CGs can also be used in looser, less disciplined ways that can accommodate the vagueness and ambiguity of natural languages. This chapter surveys the history of conceptual graphs, their relationship to other knowledge representation languages, and their use in the design and implementation of intelligent systems.},

  title = {Diagrammatic {{Reasoning With EGs}} and {{EGIF}}},
  author = {Sowa, John F.},
  abstract = {Diagrammatic reasoning dominated mathematics until algebraic methods became popular in the 17th century. Although Peirce developed the algebraic notation for predicate calculus in 1885, he kept searching for a more iconic graph-based logic. In 1897, he developed existential graphs (EGs), which have the full expressive power of the ISO standard for Common Logic (CL). In the last two decades of his life, Peirce wrote extensively about diagrammatic reasoning as a general theory and EGs as the formal representation. They are two aspects of the same theory. Peirce's rules of inference for EGs can be generalized to any notation for logic, linear or graphic. Two additional rules, which he described informally, are observation and imagination. For precisely defined diagrams, as in Euclid's geometry, those operations can be defined formally. To bridge the gap between algebra and diagrams, the Existential Graph Interchange Format (EGIF) has a formal mapping to EGs and to Common Logic. When the rules of observation and imagination are defined in terms of EGIF, they enable any software developed for Common Logic to be used in diagrammatic reasoning.},

  abstract = {Existential graphs (EGs) are a simple, readable, and expressive graphic notation for logic. Conceptual graphs (CGs) combine a logical foundation based on EGs with features of the semantic networks used in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. CG design principles address logical, linguistic, and cognitive requirements: a formal semantics defined by the ISO standard for Common Logic; the flexibility to support the expressiveness, context dependencies, and metalevel commentary of natural language; and cognitively realistic operations for reasoning by induction, deduction, abduction, and analogy. To accommodate the vagueness and ambiguities of natural language, informal heuristics can supplement the formal semantics. With sufficient background knowledge and a clarifying dialog, informal graphs can be refined to any degree of precision. Peirce claimed that the rules for reasoning with EGs generate ``a moving picture of the action of the mind in thought.'' Some philosophers and psychologists agree: Peirce's diagrams and rules are a good candidate for a natural logic that reflects the neural processes that support thought and language. They are psychologically realistic and computationally efficient.},

The task of translating information from a textbook to a computable semantic form requires the combined skills of a linguist, logician, computer scientist, and subject-matter expert. Any system that requires its users to have all those skills will have few, if any, users. The challenge is to design automated tools that can combine the contributions from multiple experts with different kinds of skills. This article surveys systems with different levels of semantics: lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight. Linked data systems with lightweight semantics are easy to develop, but they can't interpret the data they link. The heavyweight systems of traditional AI can perform deep reasoning, but they place too many demands on the knowledge engineers. No one can predict what innovations will be discovered in the future, but commercially successful systems must satisfy two criteria: first, they must solve problems for which a large number of people need solutions; second, they must have automated and semi-automated methods for acquiring, analyzing, and organizing the required knowledge.},

However, people have a remarkable ability to learn and to extend their understanding without explicit training. Fundamental to human understanding is the ability to learn and use language in social interactions that Wittgenstein called language games. Those games use and extend prelinguistic knowledge learned through perception, action, and social interactions. A computer system that relates language to virtual models might mimic some aspects of understanding, but full understanding requires the ability to learn and use new knowledge in social and sensory-motor interactions. This talk examines various technology for designing and implementing language processors. It suggests ways of using that technology to support computer systems that could come close to what people would consider understanding.},

  abstract = {The issues raised by Wittgenstein's language games are fundamental to any theory of semantics, formal or informal. Montague's view of natural language as a version of formal logic is at best an approximation to a single language game or a family of closely related games. But it is not unusual for a short phrase or sentence to introduce, comment on, or combine aspects of multiple language games. The option of dynamically switching from one game to another enables natural languages to adapt to any possible subject from any perspective for any humanly conceivable purpose. But the option of staying within one precisely defined game enables natural languages to attain the kind of precision that is achieved in a mathematical formalism. To support the flexibility of natural languages and the precision of formal languages within a common framework, this article drops the assumption of a fixed logic. Instead, it proposes a dynamic framework of logics and ontologies that can accommodate the shifting points of view and methods of argumentation and negotiation that are common during discourse. Such a system is necessary to characterize the open-ended variety of language use in different applications at different stages of life --- everything from an infant learning a first language to the most sophisticated adult language in science and engineering.},

  abstract = {Diagrammatic reasoning, based on visualization and analogy, is the foundation for reasoning in ordinary language and the most esoteric theories of mathematics. Long before they write a formal proof, mathematicians develop their ideas with diagrams, visualize novel patterns, and discover creative analogies. For over two millennia, Euclid's diagrammatic methods set the standard for mathematical rigor. But the abstract algebra of the 19th century led many mathematicians to claim that all formal reasoning must be algebraic. Yet C. S. Peirce and George Polya recognized that Euclid's diagrammatic reasoning is a better match to human thought patterns than algebraic rules and notations. Peirce's graph logic, combined with Polya's heuristics and Euclid's diagrams, is a better candidate for a natural logic than any algebraic formalism. Psychologically, it supports Peirce's claim that his existential graphs (EGs) provide ``a moving picture of the action of the mind in thought.'' Logically, EGs have a formal mapping to and from the ISO standard for Common Logic. Computationally, algorithms for Cognitive Memory (CM) and virtual reality (VR) can support cross-modal analogies between language-like and image-like representations, static or dynamic.},

  abstract = {Consciousness-raising practices at the heart of feminism remain one of the most vital components of transformative learning theory and provide the foundation for its constructivist underpinnings. Recently, there has been a call for educators to employ consciousness-raising practices outside of traditional classroom settings and to focus greater attention on the`extra-rational'aspects of education -- especially when working with marginalised adult learners. This is very much in keeping with engaged feminist pedagogy that allows space for emotions in learning. Reflecting on our experiences facilitating access to art programmes with people diagnosed with mental illness and addiction at the Art Gallery of Ontario, we highlight several examples of genderrelated consciousness-raising that emerged. These experiences suggest that exploring mental illness through engagement with art in a social setting allows participants to deepen their understanding of art and the political implications of their life experiences. These tours also seem to serve as a powerful counterpoint to more clinical and masculine ways of framing mental health and well-being. Ultimately we argue that it is our explicitly feminist approach to transformative learning and not the existence of accessibility programmes themselves that holds the promise of redefining what and who museums are for.},

Despite the raging world war, Rudolf Steiner was still actively touring Central Europe whilst simultaneously completing work on his architectural masterpiece, the first Goetheanum, in neutral Switzerland. The building of the Goetheanum - undertaken by a community of people from seventeen nations at war - forms a thematic backdrop to the lectures. In speaking of the walls in the new building, for example, Rudolf Steiner describes how their forms are not confining, but rather express an openness to the surrounding cosmos. Likewise, the carved motifs on the architraves of the wooden pillars are not fixed 'symbols' but are alive and continually metamorphosing . These observations are reflected in Steiner's broader discussions. He speaks of extending and deepening our connection with the world and the cosmos, going beyond our usual narrow limits and definitions to engage in 'community with the realities of existence'. We can do this, for example, with the so-called 'dead', who find it difficult to relate to sense-bound thinking. Rudolf Steiner explains how we can connect with them, greatly enriching our lives and 'making an enormous difference to their souls'. The distinction between fixed symbols and living motifs takes us to the core of anthroposophy, striving never to rest in inert forms of thought. In the field of education, Steiner thus warns about 'external measuring' of pupils and linear models of cognitive learning. Throughout the three lecture courses included here - which together form a kind of compendium of anthroposophy at the time - Steiner touches upon a wealth of absorbing themes, including the 'discovery' of America, the contrast between East and West, the qualities of European 'folk souls', Valentin Andreae's Chymical Wedding, and Darwinism. Regardless of his topic, however, Steiner consistently makes the urgent appeal that we 'grasp reality', looking further than abstract schemes of all kinds - such as social and political 'programmes' - to participate in the cosmos as conscious and fully human co-creators},

  abstract = {In the two lecture courses featured in this volume, Rudolf Steiner presents a radical new paradigm. Tackling the central dilemma of modern civilization - the polarisation of science and spirituality - he seeks to broaden natural science through a comprehensive spiritual science. Rather than harking back to old spiritual forms or religions, Steiner's approach is based on a conscious and systematic intensification of thinking and perception. Rudolf Steiner approaches this spiritual-scientific task from two perspectives. In Kassel, Germany, he deepens insight into theosophy and Rosicrucianism, showing their relationship to science and religion. Although presented as an 'introduction', Steiner was never interested in simply providing information - not even in the form of new revelations - and his insights are from fresh angles and with new illustrative examples. These lectures deepen and develop key elements found in his fundamental works Occult Science, An Outline and Theosophy. Also featured are the fascinating question-and-answer sessions from the Kassel lectures. In Basel, Switzerland, Rudolf Steiner discusses that most esoteric of the accounts of the life of Christ: the Gospel of John. Whilst the focus is on the gospel, basic tenets of spiritual science, human existence and world evolution are considered, as is the concept of karma and the true nature of Christianity. In both sets of lectures Steiner dwells on the Prologue to the Gospel of John (given in his own translation), which offers a meditative approach to gaining insight into both the gospel and Christianity as a whole. Rather than distancing us from life, each of the lectures in this volume brings us closer to reality},

  abstract = {The mental lexicon is a complex cognitive system representing information about the words/concepts that one knows. Over decades psychological experiments have shown that conceptual associations across multiple, interactive cognitive levels can greatly influence word acquisition, storage, and processing. How can semantic, phonological, syntactic, and other types of conceptual associations be mapped within a coherent mathematical framework to study how the mental lexicon works? Here we review cognitive multilayer networks as a promising quantitative and interpretative framework for investigating the mental lexicon. Cognitive multilayer networks can map multiple types of information at once, thus capturing how different layers of associations might co-exist within the mental lexicon and influence cognitive processing. This review starts with a gentle introduction to the structure and formalism of multilayer networks. We then discuss quantitative mechanisms of psychological phenomena that could not be observed in single-layer networks and were only unveiled by combining multiple layers of the lexicon: (i) multiplex viability highlights language kernels and facilitative effects of knowledge processing in healthy and clinical populations; (ii) multilayer community detection enables contextual meaning reconstruction depending on psycholinguistic features; (iii) layer analysis can mediate latent interactions of mediation, suppression, and facilitation for lexical access. By outlining novel quantitative perspectives where multilayer networks can shed light on cognitive knowledge representations, including in next-generation brain/mind models, we discuss key limitations and promising directions for cutting-edge future research.},

Based on the general doctrine of diagrams in Charles Peirce's mature work, Diagrammatology claims diagrams to constitute a centerpiece of epistemology. The book reflects Peirce's work on the issue in Husserl's contemporanous doctrine of "categorial intuition" and charts the many unnoticed similarities between Peircean semiotics and early Husserlian phenomenology. Diagrams, on a Peircean account, allow for observation and experimentation with ideal structures and objects and thus furnish the access to the synthetic a priori of the regional and formal ontology of the Husserlian tradition. The second part of the book focuses on three regional branches of semiotics: biosemiotics, picture analysis, and the theory of literature. Based on diagrammatology, these domains appear as accessible for a diagrammatological approach which leaves the traditional relativism and culturalism of semiotics behind and hence constitutes a realist semiotics.},

  abstract = {In recent years, spiking neural networks were introduced in science as the third generation of artificial neural networks leading to a tremendous energy saving on neuromorphic processors. This sustainable effect is due to the sparse nature of signal processing in-between spiking neurons leading to much less scalar multiplications as in second-generation networks. The spiking neuron's efficiency is even more pronounced by their inherently recurrent nature being useful for recursive function approximations. We believe that there is a need for a general regression framework for SNNs to explore the high potential of neuromorphic computations. However, besides many classification studies with SNNs in the literature, nonlinear neuromorphic regression analysis represents a gap in research. Hence, we propose a general SNN approach for function approximation applicable for complex transient signal processing taking surrogate gradients due to the discontinuous spike representation into account. However, to pay attention to the need for high memory access during deep SNN network communications, additional spiking Legrendre Memory Units are introduced in the neuromorphic architecture. Path-dependencies and evolutions of signals can be tackled in this way. Furthermore, interfaces between real physical and binary spiking values are necessary. Following this intention, a hybrid approach is introduced, exhibiting an autoencoding strategy between dense and spiking layers. However, to verify the presented framework of nonlinear regression for a wide spectrum of scientific purposes, we see the need for obtaining realistic complex transient short-time signals by an extensive experimental set-up. Hence, a measurement technique for benchmark experiments is proposed with high-frequency oscillations measured by capacitive and piezoelectric sensors resulting in wave propagations and inelastic solid deformations to be predicted by the developed SNN regression analysis. Hence, the proposed nonlinear regression framework can be deployed to a wide range of scientific and technical applications.},

We use persistent homology with a weight rank clique filtration to gain insights into these functional networks, and we use persistence landscapes to interpret our results. Our first example uses time-series output from networks of coupled Kuramoto oscillators. Our second example consists of biological data in the form of functional magnetic resonance imaging data that were acquired from human subjects during a simple motor-learning task in which subjects were monitored for three days during a five-day period. With these examples, we demonstrate that (1) using persistent homology to study functional networks provides fascinating insights into their properties and (2) the position of the features in a filtration can sometimes play a more vital role than persistence in the interpretation of topological features, even though conventionally the latter is used to distinguish between signal and noise. We find that persistent homology can detect differences in synchronization patterns in our data sets over time, giving insight both on changes in community structure in the networks and on increased synchronization between brain regions that form loops in a functional network during motor learning. For the motor-learning data, persistence landscapes also reveal that on average the majority of changes in the network loops take place on the second of the three days of the learning process.},

In response, we propose Dilated Iterated Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DIG-CNNs) for graph-based dependency parsing, a graph convolutional architecture that allows for efficient end-to-end GPU parsing. In experiments on the English Penn TreeBank benchmark, we show that DIG-CNNs perform on par with some of the best neural network parsers.},

  abstract = {From dirty data to intentional deception, there are many threats to the validity of data-driven decisions. Making use of data, especially new or unfamiliar data, therefore requires a degree of trust or verification. How is this trust established? In this paper, we present the results of a series of interviews with both producers and consumers of data artifacts (outputs of data ecosystems like spreadsheets, charts, and dashboards) aimed at understanding strategies and obstacles to building trust in data. We find a recurring need, but lack of existing standards, for data validation and verification, especially among data consumers. We therefore propose a set of data guards: methods and tools for fostering trust in data artifacts.},

  abstract = {Design is a historically informed, future-facing activity.  Transitioning to a low carbon, sustainable society will require many new objects, processes and systems to harvest sustainable energy.  Developing a historically informed approach to the design of energy harvesting information systems is the central rationale for this study.  The dissertation explores this research question in four activities: the first is a collection of energy harvesting information objects and media of photovoltaic design history -- for the descriptive study of material form, use, function and durability, informed by the practices of museums and collections scholarship, for a gathering and interpretation of texts.  The second is a technical history of the design of these devices -- how they were created, came to market, function, and persist, from a socially oriented, material perspective.  The third discusses the design history from foci which characterized their historical development and are significant concerns of the energy transition: colonialism / nation building, environmental impact and social justice.  The fourth presents speculative design-experiments that reflect and reimagine, a "response" to this newly assembled collection of historical objects as hybrid transitions designs. The four activities enact complementary methods addressing specific challenges of historical context, analysis methodology and micro-macro readings of the domain, while reflecting on how social issues of colonialism or nation-building, the environment and social justice have changed.  The broad intellectual contribution is to the corpus of science and technology studies, STS writings about energy history, a persistent and significant interest of this field.  The more specific contribution is to energy transition design techniques as related to information studies, where responses to planetary warming levels of critical and exigent concern are urgently required.},

Those tropes are of ontological status, and therefore they are of key importance in understanding the discursive ``production'' of identity in political and educational practices. I use the conceptions of both Laclau and Eco to elucidate the operation of this structure, and illustrate it with an example of the emergence of the ``Solidarnos{\textasciiacute}c{\textasciiacute}'' movement in Poland, expanding its analysis provided by Laclau. I focus on the moment when one of particular demands assumes the representation of totality, which, in Laclau, is left to ``circumstantial'' determination. This moment inspires several questions and needs to be given special attention if Laclau's theory is to be used in theory of education. It is so because theory of education cannot remain on the level of the ontological (which is the core of Laclau's achievement), but has to theorize ``nonontological'' dimensions as well, that is the ontic (i.e. ``content'' of education), the deontic (duty, obligation, and the normative in general), as well as what I call the deontological---the very relation between ``what there is'' and ``what there is not'' (including that which should be) as the locus of education.},

Where the inner and outer worlds meet we discover our own true nature mirrored in the Earth's wild beauty and fierce challenges. A powerful archetypal model for transformation, the "soulscapes" return us to a primal terrain rich in knowing, healing, and wholeness. To guide our path, each soulscape offers up wisdom in the form of soul qualities the modern world often undervalues and even undermines. We see how deserts model simplicity and silence, how forests help us make peace with uncertainty, how rivers and oceans reveal the power of flow, how mountains inspire our highest purpose, and how grasslands teach us about giving back. Weaving personal story with poetry, imagery, and explorations, Reclaiming the Wild Soul is simultaneously self-help and a courageous call to action. It is written for all those disillusioned with our hyper-paced, high-tech world, who decry what we are doing to the Earth, who feel the tug of their own wild souls longing for discovery and mystery - a new, yet ancient, way of being human.

  abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), introduction of well-defined and standardized evaluation methodologies remains a crucial challenge. This paper traces the historical trajectory of LLM evaluations, from the foundational questions posed by Alan Turing to the modern era of AI research. We categorize the evolution of LLMs into distinct periods, each characterized by its unique benchmarks and evaluation criteria. As LLMs increasingly mimic human-like behaviors, traditional evaluation proxies, such as the Turing test, have become less reliable. We emphasize the pressing need for a unified evaluation system, given the broader societal implications of these models. Through an analysis of common evaluation methodologies, we advocate for a qualitative shift in assessment approaches, underscoring the importance of standardization and objective criteria. This work serves as a call for the AI community to collaboratively address the challenges of LLM evaluation, ensuring their reliability, fairness, and societal benefit.},

The research conceptualized how program elements enabled both individual experiences and relational processes to occur. These components operated within a context that was enriched by the museum as a place to support wellbeing and enhance social interaction. To meaningfully support socially isolated older people as part of local public health strategies, museums need to be accessible and engaging places that purposively support social interaction by involving people and objects, participating in multiple sessions over time, that are facilitated by skilled and knowledgeable staff.},

If you're a data scientist or coder, this practical book - now revised in full color - shows you how to train and scale these large models using "Hugging Face Transformers", a Python-based deep learning library. Transformers have been used to write realistic news stories, improve Google Search queries, and even create chatbots that tell corny jokes. In this guide, authors Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf, among the creators of "Hugging Face Transformers", use a hands-on approach to teach you how transformers work and how to integrate them in your applications. You'll quickly learn a variety of tasks they can help you solve. Build, debug, and optimize transformer models for core NLP tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering. Learn how transformers can be used for cross-lingual transfer learning. Apply transformers in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. Make transformer models efficient for deployment using techniques such as distillation, pruning, and quantization. Train transformers from scratch and learn how to scale to multiple GPUs and distributed environments},

  abstract = {The developments in communication technology didn't only affect the visible side of life but also transformed the ways of thinking, perception and interpretation. The form of communication through visuals is accepted to be the reality of today. On the other hand, the digital evolution due to the advances in technology has had the advantage of ever increasing flow of data and information. Therefore, processing the intense, unorganized and complex data to transform them into meaningful and useful datasets has become an area gaining more importance. Making information more understandable for wider audience requires the presentation of data through systematic visualization. Therefore, infographics have become an element that is used more frequently in every media. Infographics fulfil a very important need in this age by presenting the information and data that increases due to technological developments through an understanding focusing on functionality and aesthetics where visual communication is in the center. In understanding infographics, the visual literacy level of the user is a factor that is as important as the quality of the design. This article examines the relation of visual literacy with the process of reading, perceiving and interpreting the infographics.},

The best expression of terroir is achieved when the precocity of the grapevine variety is suited to the local climatic conditions in such a way that full ripeness is reached by the end of the growing season. For the production of high quality red wines, environmental conditions should induce moderate vine vigour, either through moderate water deficit stress or through low nitrogen supply.

  abstract = {This paper offers a critique and reformulation of the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) pyramid. Today, collection of personal, business, industrial, and other types of data has never been more pervasive and invasive. Data storage now is measured in yottabytes (56~septillion bits of data) and beyond. This collected data is interrogated, monetized, hacked, and otherwise handled and mishandled around the world at an increasingly rapid pace due to improvements in technology. The interrogated data becomes information, but whether this information is useful or valuable depends entirely on the manner of interrogation and the accuracy of the underlying data. In turn, information could become knowledge but not necessarily, and not necessarily useful knowledge either. Knowledge and wisdom are also closely related, but wisdom typically contains a volume and longevity of collected knowledge and a purpose. Are humans more knowledgeable or wiser for today's massive amounts of collected data? This paper examines the traditional DIKW pyramid and proposes a revised DIKW relationship based on a Venn diagram to better reflect the relationship between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom.},

The framework recognises several distinct phases, leading from the initial gathering of information, through to the production of outputs intended as input into the more familiar activities of strategy development and strategic planning. The framework is also useful as a diagnostic tool for examining how foresight work and strategy are undertaken, as well as a design aid for customised foresight projects and processes. Some observations and reflections are made on lessons learned from a two-and-a-half year engagement as an organisationally-based foresight practitioner. NOTE: This framework has recently (2017) been updated and re-worked in a new book chapter: Big History and Anticipation: Using Big History as a framework for global foresight.

  abstract = {This dissertation studies the wave of interest in ``decentralization'' over the last decade led by a loose group of technical subcultures and communities building new computing and networking technologies. While technical decentralization has a long history, this recent interest extends the concept with claims of its central role in radical social transformations. Its proponents often offer sophisticated assessments of the issues facing the web and internet today, yet frequently propose fundamentally different solutions than those envisioned by scholars and other activists. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the social worlds in which decentralization has emerged as well as the interplay between values and socio-technical imaginaries accompanying it within some decentralizing technologies. In three articles, this dissertation characterizes technical decentralization and the forces within current interest in it. It uses an autoethnographic approach and collective reflection to report on two projects using decentralized technologies to build alternatives to existing data stewardship and publishing infrastructures. This dissertation situates those projects within the ``DWeb'' community and growing ``Web3'' movement through interviews and analysis of public talks and writing from organizations advocating decentralization. This dissertation highlights how decentralization as a concept remains ambivalent. It traces how proponents draw on the concept's historical dimensions to develop distinct values and articulate visions of the future. It examines what is being decentralized and how within the data stewardship project, reports on the decentralized publishing software modelling values and principles, and provides sensitizing concepts for technical decentralization drawn from its broader historical and political context. Decentralization remains elusive throughout. The dissertation ends looking back at these explorations and asking whether decentralization is a concept worth claiming in the fight for a better internet.},

  abstract = {Higher-order networks are able to capture the many-body interactions present in complex systems and to unveil new fundamental phenomena revealing the rich interplay between topology, geometry, and dynamics. Simplicial complexes are higher-order networks that encode higher-order topology and dynamics of complex systems. Specifically, simplicial complexes can sustain topological signals, i.e., dynamical variables not only defined on nodes of the network but also on their edges, triangles, and so on. Topological signals can undergo collective phenomena such as synchronization, however, only some higher-order network topologies can sustain global synchronization of topological signals. Here we consider global topological synchronization of topological signals on weighted simplicial complexes. We demonstrate that topological signals can globally synchronize on weighted simplicial complexes, even if they are odd-dimensional, e.g., edge signals, overcoming thus a limitation of the unweighted case. These results thus demonstrate that weighted simplicial complexes are more advantageous for observing these collective phenomena than their unweighted counterpart. In particular, we present two weighted simplicial complexes the Weighted Triangulated Torus and the Weighted Waffle. We completely characterize their higher-order spectral properties and we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions on their weights, they can sustain global synchronization of edge signals. Our results are interpreted geometrically by showing, among the other results, that in some cases edge weights can be associated with the lengths of the sides of curved simplices.},

Here, we propose the first inductive learning setting for CKG completion, where unseen entities may appear at test time. We emphasize that the inductive learning setting is crucial for CKGs, because unseen entities are frequently introduced due to the fact that CKGs are dynamic and highly sparse. We propose InductivE as the first framework targeted at the inductive CKG completion task. InductivE first ensures the inductive learning capability by directly computing entity embeddings from raw entity attributes. Second, a graph neural network with novel densification process is proposed to further enhance unseen entity representation with neighboring structural information. Experimental results show that InductivE performs especially well on inductive scenarios where it achieves above 48\% improvement over previous methods while also outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in transductive settings.},

The first experiment was designed to provide quantitative measurements of how much more (or less) can be understood in 3D than in 2D. The 3D display used was configured so that the image on the monitor was coupled to the user's actual eye positions (and it was updated in real-time as the user moved) as well as being in stereo. Thus the effect was like a local "virtual reality" display located in the vicinity of the computer monitor. The results from this study show that head-coupled stereo viewing can increase the size of an abstract graph that can be understood by a factor of three; using stereo alone provided an increase by a factor of 1.6 and head coupling alone produced an increase by a factor of 2.2.

  abstract = {It has been known for some time that larger graphs can be interpreted if laid out in 3D and displayed with stereo and/or motion depth cues to support spatial perception. However, prior studies were carried out using displays that provided a level of detail far short of what the human visual system is capable of resolving. Therefore, we undertook a graph comprehension study using a very high resolution stereoscopic display. In our first experiment, we examined the effect of stereoscopic display, kinetic depth, and using 3D tubes versus lines to display the links. The results showed a much greater benefit for 3D viewing than previous studies. For example, with both motion and stereoscopic depth cues, unskilled observers could see paths between nodes in 333 node graphs with less than a 10\% error rate. Skilled observers could see up to a 1000-node graph with less than a 10\% error rate. This represented an order of magnitude increase over 2D display. In our second experiment, we varied both nodes and links to understand the constraints on the number of links and the size of graph that can be reliably traced. We found the difference between number of links and number of nodes to best account for error rates and suggest that this is evidence for a ``perceptual phase transition.'' These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for information display.},

  abstract = {The current ``narrow'' or ``weak'' form of artificial intelligence is, by itself, fundamentally a data analysis tool that does nothing more or less than its programming instructs it to do. It has no values or goals of its own, it simply follows the values and pursues the goals provided to it by its programmers. Artificial wisdom has the potential to make artificial intelligence a better tool and eventually perhaps more than a tool, but at least for now artificial wisdom must also be programmed and therefore similarly reflects only the wisdom of its programmers. Artificial intelligence, with its reductionistic ontology of data and its contrived epistemology of algorithms, is the quintessential product of the Western scientific worldview, and the development and application of artificial intelligence and discussions of artificial wisdom still largely reflect that one, narrow worldview. Artificial wisdom would greatly benefit from incorporating elements of non-Western worldviews, particularly the metaphysically inclusive Indigenous worldview. For example, the Navajo concept of hozho involves the normative values and goals of harmony, balance, interrelatedness, and connectedness. Hozho and other Indigenous concepts are potentially paradigm-shifting additions to artificial wisdom and could greatly enhance the usefulness of and overall benefit from applications of artificial intelligence.},

This tool helps users understand complex machine learning architectures by visualizing their underlying dataflow graphs. The tool works by applying a series of graph transformations that enable standard layout techniques to produce a legible interactive diagram. To declutter the graph, we decouple non-critical nodes from the layout. To provide an overview, we build a clustered graph using the hierarchical structure annotated in the source code. To support exploration of nested structure on demand, we perform edge bundling to enable stable and responsive cluster expansion. Finally, we detect and highlight repeated structures to emphasize a model's modular composition. To demonstrate the utility of the visualizer, we describe example usage scenarios and report user feedback. Overall, users find the visualizer useful for understanding, debugging, and sharing the structures of their models.},

I express this through a Rosetta Stone metaphor and how, as a design researcher, I developed this concept when I had to pierce through Peirce's pragmatic semiotic theory to enhance aesthetic practice. I initially found it a challenge to understand Peirce's unfamiliar academic terminology without any prior formal education in Pragmatism or semiotic theory. The problem for designers is that theoretical language can be intimidating, arcane and opaque. In reviewing the Peircean literature I identified an absence of designer-centric literature, which would quickly facilitate designers' understanding of Semiosis. This paper therefore is a progressive call for more concerted collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners. This would ideally lead to new designer-centric Peircean literature being published, leading to the enhancement of aesthetic creative practice.},

  abstract = {Given the broad popularization of AI creative tools in contemporary society, this thesis explores the use of natural language interfaces by game designers as a primary gameplay mechanic to facilitate the expressive goals of the underrepresented game-maker. The creative contributions of underrepresented game-makers hold cultural significance,hence, this research strongly advocates for the democratization of game-making tools, a need further underscored by the emergence of AI development. Such democratization is crucial as it addresses the exploitation of their creative labor within AI development, which frequently disregards the languages and cultures of marginalized communities in language models. Drawing from J.L. Austin's Speech Act Theory and Suzanne Keen's Theory of Narrative Empathy, the research aims to provide a framework for game-makers to engage players in meaningful conversations with AI Non-Player Characters (NPCs) using large language models. The hypothesis suggests that language shapes how we perceive our relation to others, and aims to animate expressive qualities by holding players accountable for the words they use within the game. This project uses a Research-through-Design methodology which entails making a game, documenting the process and findings in a developer's journal, and finally synthesizing results to share best practice guidelines with other game-makers. These guidelines offer suggestions for implementing a natural language interface that takes into consideration the AI language model, the game-maker, and the player. Additionally, they provide a framework for facilitating a game-maker's expressive goals using the theories outlined in this project, and offer strategies for holding players accountable for their words by fostering meaningful actions in a game utilizing large language models. The importance of this research lies in its aim to provide tools to underrepresented game-makers, via this document and publishing online, enabling them to leverage the affordances of large language models and allowing for the creation of their own unique stories.},

  abstract = {The rationales behind design are dissimilar to those behind art. Establishing an adequate theoretical foundation for conducting design education can facilitate scientising design methods. Thus, from the perspectives of the semiotic theories proposed by Saussure and Peirce, we investigated graphic design curricula by performing teaching experiments, verifying the adequacy of applying these theories to poster design. During the teaching experiment, a matched groups design method was used for assigning 30 students to either an experimental group or a control group. The results of the experiment revealed that compared with the control group students, the experimental group students, who applied the semiotic theories to their poster designs, performed more favourably in image creativity, picture aesthetic, typography, and total poster design score. The posters created by the students were submitted to International Triennial of Ecological Posters `the 4th Block', and a total of 4 creations from the experimental group were accepted. The results of the teaching experiment verify that applying semiotic theories to graphic design curricula facilitates improving student ability to observe objects and cultivating their capability to design posters and reinforce the visual tension in the posters.},

  abstract = {Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.},

A common way of representing such data are node-link diagrams as they support analysts in achieving a mental model of the data. However, na{\"i}ve 3D depictions of complex graphs tend to be visually cluttered, even more than in a 2D layout. This makes graph exploration and data analysis less efficient. This problem can be addressed by edge bundling. We introduce a 3D cluster-based edge bundling algorithm that is inspired by the force-directed edge bundling (FDEB) algorithm [HvW09b] and fulfills the requirements to be embedded in an interactive framework for spatial data analysis. It is parallelized and scales with the size of the graph regarding the runtime. Furthermore, it maintains the edge's model and thus supports rendering the graph in different structural styles. We demonstrate this with a graph originating from a simulation of the function of a macaque brain.},

At present, despite the positioning of integration as the defining activity of interdisciplinarity, interdisciplinary work tends to be evaluated on the basis of final outcomes, at the expense of a clear understanding of what interdisciplinary integration actually is. This thesis problematizes this outcome focus and makes the case for a practice-focused approach, using conceptual modeling and network analysis of the data holdings of in-progress interdisciplinary research projects to explore how researchers integrate data from multiple disciplines. These case studies demonstrate that even in ostensibly interdisciplinary research, data tend to be analyzed in disciplinary silos, leaving any integration that occurs to take place in an ad-hoc, after-the-fact fashion. The adverse implications of this finding on interdisciplinarity are discussed, and a framework for the repositioning of integration as a research practice is proposed as a potential solution.},
