    To recall a humorous example from the origins of computational text methods, Tim Berners-Lee’s Information Management (1989) was received by his supervisor Mike Sendall as “Vague, but exciting…” \citep{cern_tim_2008}. In this thesis I advocate for giving novel ideas a chance, even if they are not fully formed, including my own. If you are a topologist or computer scientist inclined to lean forward past vagueness into excitement, I heartily welcome your collaboration.
