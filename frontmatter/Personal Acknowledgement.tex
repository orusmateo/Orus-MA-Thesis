\section*{Students and Co-Learners}
To my students, whose enthusiasm has fuelled this work, from OCAD University, the Amity School of Engineering \& Technology, and Collective65. Thank you for our shared journey of discovery.

\section*{Academic Family}
In OCAD University's graduate programs-Digital Futures (DF), Strategic Foresight and Innovation (SFI), Interdisciplinary Master's of Art, Media and Design (IAMD), and Criticism and Curatorial Practice (CCP)- I found support and friendship with Alberto, Anusha, Dedra, Deepikah, E.J., Hala, Jennifer-Amy, Jessica, Jiyeon, Juan, Lo, Matthew, Mufaro, Purvi, Raquel, Ricardo, Rim, Sal, Sara, Shipra, Tamika, Taylor, Tyler, and Yu.

Two people deserve special mention: Alberto Castillo for walking with me as I work through my \textit{mestizaje} and the larger web of our relationships- \textit{gracias amigo}; and Hala Alsalman, for always finding clever ways to laugh together despite the seriousness of our work.

\section*{Friends and Inspirations}

\section*{At My Core}
To the ancestors whose story my family retells as a source of hope and resilience, especially Mario Castaño Pérez, and Mariela Castaño Pérez, for your enduring example. 

To my mother Gloria Margarita Castaño Suárez, my first teacher of design, and matriarch of my family, for sustaining our stories across the expanses of continents; to my father Carlos Arturo Castaño Castaño, for being our family’s rock while we faced seemingly impossible odds; to my elder brother Carlos Agusto, for your intercession; to my younger brother Simón, for your mindful rebelliousness and exuberant support, and for being my hope. To my future sister-in-law, Angela, for bringing joy to my brother. To my partner Carmen, for your tender presence on this path.

\section*{To the More-Than-Human World}
To the waters, especially Lake Ontario, for calling me and insisting that I visit. As an extension of my parents, sitting with you makes it easier for the harmony which exists before language to resurface. To the red-tailed hawks, thank you for visiting on days I was in most need of re-encountering trust in the invisible parts of life.
