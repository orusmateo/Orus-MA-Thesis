I am committed to fostering equitable and just academic discourse by actively challenging oppressive language and practices. This thesis includes critiques of terms that are ableist, racist, colonialist, or otherwise oppressive. I quote the use terms such as ``blind spots,” ``black box AI,” and ``stakeholder” in order to critique them, not to perpetuate them. I acknowledge that my efforts to dismantle harmful language while relearning more just terminology is an incomplete work in progress.

I welcome ongoing dialogue about my language choices and am committed to refining my communication to be more inclusive and anti-oppressive. Readers are encouraged to engage critically with my language use and to bring any concerns or suggestions to my attention.\input{frontmatter/authorlist}
