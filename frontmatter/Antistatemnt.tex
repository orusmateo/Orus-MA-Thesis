I am committed to fostering equitable and just academic discourse by actively challenging oppressive language and practices. This thesis includes critiques of terms that are ableist, racist, colonialist, or otherwise oppressive. I quote the use of the terms ``blind spots,” ``black box AI,” and ``stakeholder” to critique them and limit their perpetuation. I acknowledge that my efforts to dismantle harmful language while relearning more just terminology are an incomplete work in progress. As such, I welcome ongoing dialogue about my research and am committed to improving the anti-oppression and non-violence of my communication.
