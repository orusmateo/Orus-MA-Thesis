I honour this land. I have been hosted on it as a refugee, child, sibling, and student. Humans have lived here for thousands of years before it was  ``discovered" by settlers. I understand this land to be the territory of the Anishinaabeg, Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. I understand this territory to be part of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant. I am grateful for my relationships with the people who are of this land, from across Turtle Island, and from across Abya Yala.
