I honour this land. I have been hosted on it as a refugee, settler, child, sibling, and student. Humans have lived in relationship with this place long before it was ``discovered" by settlers. I understand this land to be part of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, and the territory of the Anishinaabeg, Wendat, and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit River. I am grateful for my relationships with the people who are of this land, as well as guests here from across Turtle Island, Abya Yala, and beyond.
