In an era where information overload impedes our capacity to address the escalating climate crisis, we are in a crisis of understanding. This thesis introduces novel methods of amplifying human visuospatial ability by applying topological data analysis methods on semantic information like text and graphs. I propose a Topological Capta Analysis (TCA) Workspace platform, which integrates several original contributions, including Semantic Forms (three-dimensional text graph compositions), Query Isomorphs (dimensionally versatile graphlets), and Ontological Semantic Network Summaries (revealing a text's operative ontological framework using semantic networks). By revealing underused frameworks between academic fields, TCA Workspace activates text and graphs into knowledge across four modes: knowledge surfacing, synthesis, translation, and creation. TCA Workspace aims to build on Systemic Design methods and LLMs to foster the rapid interdisciplinary collaboration necessary for addressing wicked problems like the global warming hyperobject.
