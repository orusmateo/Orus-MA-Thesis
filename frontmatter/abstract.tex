The escalating severity of the climate crisis, combined with information overload, hinders our ability to respond as interdisciplinary researchers. In this thesis, I propose anticipatory designs for a novel platform aiming to reveal information we already know in ways that facilitate dialogue between academic disciplines.

I introduce original contributions, including Semantic Forms (3D text-graph compositions), Query Isomorphs (dimensionally versatile graphlets), Ontological Semantic Network Summaries (to reveal ontological frameworks), and the Terroir of Text and Graphs (topological analysis of the relationship between knowledge artifacts and ecological place).

By modeling Query Isomorphs across Semantic Forms, Systemic Design methods, and Language Model vector graph renders, I demonstrate opportunities to use the versatility of visuospatial reasoning in conjunction with Topological Data Analysis for information complexity management. The tools I present in this thesis comprise a platform that would accelerate the synthesis of existing knowledge and extend the applicability of that knowledge across disciplines.
