    As Director of Strategic Innovation Lab (sLab), a research hub at OCAD University committed to participatory foresight and systemic design, I was approached by Orus and found that their project aligns strongly within sLab’s methods and ethos. In their scholarly practice, Orus cultivates visual thinking, data literacy, and inclusive innovation in ways that clearly complement and advance the mission of sLab. Beyond serving as Secondary Advisor to Orus Mateo Castaño-Suárez, I formally welcome them as an Associate of sLab, and I look forward to advancing their development of this work.
